      "\n",
      "NOTE ON THE SHIRE RECORDSAt the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits in the great events that led to the inclusion of the Shire in the Reunited Kingdom awakened among them a more widespread interest in their own history; and many of their traditions, up to that time still mainly oral, were collected and written down\n",
      "\n",
      "The greater families were also concerned with events in the Kingdom at large, and many of their members studied its ancient histories and legends\n",

      "By the end of the first century of the Fourth Age there were already to be found in the Shire several libraries that contained many historical books and records\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest of these collections were probably at Under-towers, at Great Smials, and at Brandy Hall\n",
      "\n",
      "This account of the end of the Third Age is drawn mainly from the Red Book of Westmarch\n",
      "\n",
      "That most important source for the history of the War of the Ring was so called because it was long preserved at Undertowers, the home of the Fairbairns, Wardens of the Westmarch\n",
      "\n",
      "* It was in origin Bilbo’s private diary, which he took with him to Rivendell\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo brought it back to the Shire, together with many loose leaves of notes, and during S#R# 1420–1 he nearly filled its pages with his account of the War\n",
      "\n",
      "But annexed to it and preserved with it, probably in a single red case, were the three large volumes, bound in red leather, that Bilbo gave to him as a parting gift\n",

      "\n",
      "The original Red Book has not been preserved, but many copies were made, especially of the first volume, for the use of the descendants of the children of Master Samwise\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important copy, however, has a different history\n",
      "\n",
      "It was kept at Great Smials, but it was written in Gondor, probably at the request of the great-grandson of Peregrin, and completed in S#R# 1592 (F#A# 172)\n",

      "Its southern scribe appended this note: Findegil, King’s Writer, finished this work in IV 172\n",
      "\n",
      "It is an exact copy in all details of the Thain’s Book in Minas Tirith\n",
      "\n",
      "That book was a copy, made at the request of King Elessar, of the Red Book of the Periannath, and was brought to him by the Thain Peregrin when he retired to Gondor in IV 64\n",
      "\n",
      "The Thain’s Book was thus the first copy made of the Red Book and contained much that was later omitted or lost\n",
      "\n",
      "In Minas Tirith it received much annotation, and many corrections, especially of names, words, and quotations in the Elvish languages; and there was added to it an abbreviated version of those parts of The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen which lie outside the account of the War\n",
      "\n",
      "The full tale is stated to have been written by Barahir, grandson of the Steward Faramir, some time after the passing of the King\n",
      "\n",
      "But the chief importance of Findegil’s copy is that it alone contains the whole of Bilbo’s ‘Translations from the Elvish’\n",
      "\n",
      "These three volumes were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which, between 1403 and 1418, he had used all the sources available to him in Rivendell, both living and written\n",
      "\n",
      "But since they were little used by Frodo, being almost entirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Meriadoc and Peregrin became the heads of their great families, and at the same time kept up their connexions with Rohan and Gondor, the libraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough contained much that did not appear in the Red Book\n",
      "\n",
      "In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing with Eriador and the history of Rohan\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of these were composed or begun by Meriadoc himself, though in the Shire he was chiefly remembered for his Herblore of the Shire, and for his Reckoning of Years in which he discussed the relation of the calendars of the Shire and Bree to those of Rivendell, Gondor, and Rohan\n",
      "\n",
      "He also wrote a short treatise on Old Words and Names in the Shire, showing special interest in discovering the kinship with the language of the Rohirrim of such ‘shire-words’ as mathom and old elements in place names\n",
      "\n",
      "At Great Smials the books were of less interest to Shire-folk, though more important for larger history\n",
      "\n",
      "None of them was written by Peregrin, but he and his successors collected many manuscripts written by scribes of Gondor: mainly copies or summaries of histories or legends relating to Elendil and his heirs\n",
      "\n",
      "Only here in the Shire were to be found extensive materials for the history of Númenor and the arising of Sauron\n",
      "\n",
      "It was probably at Great Smials that The Tale of Years* was put together, with the assistance of material collected by Meriadoc\n",

      "Though the dates given are often conjectural, especially for the Second Age, they deserve attention\n",
      "\n",
      "It is probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance and information from Rivendell, which he visited more than once\n",

      "BOOK ONEChapter 1A LONG-EXPECTED PARTYWhen Mr# Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return\n",
      "\n",
      "The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure\n",
      "\n",
      "And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at\n",
      "\n",
      "Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr# Baggins\n",
      "\n",
      "At ninety he was much the same as at fifty\n",
      "\n",
      "At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark\n",
      "\n",
      "There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It will have to be paid for,’ they said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It isn’t natural, and trouble will come of it!’But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr# Baggins was generous with his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune\n",
      "\n",
      "He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families\n",
      "\n",
      "But he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began to grow up\n",
      "\n",
      "The eldest of these, and Bilbo’s favourite, was young Frodo Baggins\n",
      "\n",
      "When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday, September 22nd\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,’ said Bilbo one day; ‘and then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together\n",
      "\n",
      "’ At that time Frodo was still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three\n",
      "\n",
      "Twelve more years passed\n",
      "\n",
      "Each year the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number, and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33, an important number: the date of his ‘coming of age’\n",
      "\n",
      "Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "The history and character of Mr# Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand\n",
      "\n",
      "No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as the Gaffer\n",
      "\n",
      "He held forth at The Ivy Bush, a small inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job before that\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee\n",
      "\n",
      "Both father and son were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "They lived on the Hill itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr# Bilbo, as I’ve always said,’ the Gaffer declared\n",
      "\n",
      "With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to him, calling him ‘Master Hamfast’, and consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables – in the matter of ‘roots’, especially potatoes, the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood (including himself )\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But what about this Frodo that lives with him?’ asked Old Noakes of Bywater\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Baggins is his name, but he’s more than half a Brandybuck, they say\n",
      "\n",
      "It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer\n",
      "\n",
      "And no wonder they’re queer,’ put in Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer’s next-door neighbour), ‘if they live on the wrong side of the Brandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s a dark bad place, if half the tales be true\n",
      "\n",
      "You’re right, Dad!’ said the Gaffer\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not that the Brandybucks of Buckland live in the Old Forest; but they’re a queer breed, seemingly\n",
      "\n",
      "They fool about with boats on that big river – and that isn’t natural\n",
      "\n",
      "Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say\n",
      "\n",
      "But be that as it may, Mr# Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet\n",
      "\n",
      "Very much like Mr# Bilbo, and in more than looks\n",
      "\n",
      "After all his father was a Baggins\n",
      "\n",
      "A decent respectable hobbit was Mr# Drogo Baggins; there was never much to tell of him, till he was drownded\n",
      "\n",
      "Drownded?’ said several voices\n",
      "\n",
      "They had heard this and other darker rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history, and they were ready to hear it again\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, so they say,’ said the Gaffer\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You see: Mr# Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck\n",
      "\n",
      "She was our Mr# Bilbo’s first cousin on the mother’s side (her mother being the youngest of the Old Took’s daughters); and Mr# Drogo was his second cousin\n",
      "\n",
      "So Mr# Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying is, if you follow me\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mr# Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, and poor Mr# Frodo only a child and all\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,’ said Old Noakes; ‘and it was Drogo’s weight as sunk the boat\n",
      "\n",
      "And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,’ said Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,’ said the Gaffer, who did not much like the miller\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There isn’t no call to go talking of pushing and pulling\n",
      "\n",
      "Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway: there was this Mr# Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall\n",
      "\n",
      "A regular warren, by all accounts\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr# Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among decent folk\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I reckon it was a nasty knock for those Sackville-Bagginses\n",
      "\n",
      "They thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he went off and was thought to be dead\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, and has all the papers made out proper\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sackville-Bagginses won’t never see the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,’ said a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver, and jools, by what I’ve heard\n",
      "\n",
      "Then you’ve heard more than I can speak to,’ answered the Gaffer\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I know nothing about jools\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr# Bilbo is free with his money, and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw Mr# Bilbo when he came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I was a lad\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my dad’s cousin), but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the middle of it all Mr# Bilbo comes up the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign parts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn’t enough to fill tunnels\n",
      "\n",
      "But my lad Sam will know more about that\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s in and out of Bag End\n",
      "\n",
      "Crazy about stories of the old days, he is, and he listens to all Mr# Bilbo’s tales\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr# Bilbo has learned him his letters – meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Elves and Dragons! I says to him\n",
      "\n",
      "Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, or you’ll land in trouble too big for you, I says to him\n",
      "\n",
      "And I might say it to others,’ he added with a look at the stranger and the miller\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Gaffer did not convince his audience\n",
      "\n",
      "The legend of Bilbo’s wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first,’ argued the miller, voicing common opinion\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He’s often away from home\n",
      "\n",
      "And look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, and that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all\n",
      "\n",
      "You can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End’s a queer place, and its folk are queerer\n",
      "\n",
      "And you can say what you like, about what you know no more of than you do of boating, Mr# Sandyman,’ retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even more than usual\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If that’s being queer, then we could do with a bit more queerness in these parts\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s some not far away that wouldn’t offer a pint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a hole with golden walls\n",
      "\n",
      "But they do things proper at Bag End\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Sam says that everyone’s going to be invited to the party, and there’s going to be presents, mark you, presents for all – this very month as is\n",
      "\n",
      "’That very month was September, and as fine as you could ask\n",
      "\n",
      "A day or two later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable Sam) was spread about that there were going to be fireworks – fireworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh on a century, not indeed since the Old Took died\n",
      "\n",
      "Days passed and The Day drew nearer\n",
      "\n",
      "An odd-looking waggon laden with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill to Bag End\n",
      "\n",
      "The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it\n",
      "\n",
      "It was driven by outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods\n",
      "\n",
      "A few of them remained at Bag End\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight\n",
      "\n",
      "An old man was driving it all alone\n",
      "\n",
      "He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat\n",
      "\n",
      "Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through Hobbiton and right up the hill\n",
      "\n",
      "It had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly guessed\n",
      "\n",
      "At Bilbo’s front door the old man began to unload: there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red G  and the elf-rune,\n",
      "\n",
      "That was Gandalf ’s mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf the Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires, smokes, and lights\n",
      "\n",
      "His real business was far more difficult and dangerous, but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it\n",
      "\n",
      "To them he was just one of the ‘attractions’ at the Party\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence the excitement of the hobbit-children\n",
      "\n",
      "‘G for Grand!’ they shouted, and the old man smiled\n",
      "\n",
      "They knew him by sight, though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long; but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displays – they now belonged to a legendary past\n",
      "\n",
      "When the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had finished unloading, Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the onlookers\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Run away now!’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You will get plenty when the time comes\n",
      "\n",
      "’ Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door was shut\n",
      "\n",
      "The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and then made off, feeling that the day of the party would never come\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden\n",
      "\n",
      "The late afternoon was bright and peaceful\n",
      "\n",
      "The flowers glowed red and golden: snap-dragons and sunflowers, and nasturtians trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How bright your garden looks!’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Bilbo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old Shire; but I think I need a holiday\n",
      "\n",
      "You mean to go on with your plan then?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do\n",
      "\n",
      "I made up my mind months ago, and I haven’t changed it\n",
      "\n",
      "Very well\n",
      "\n",
      "It is no good saying any more\n",
      "\n",
      "Stick to your plan – your whole plan, mind – and I hope it will turn out for the best, for you, and for all of us\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope so\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have my little joke\n",
      "\n",
      "Who will laugh, I wonder?’ said Gandalf, shaking his head\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We shall see,’ said Bilbo\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts\n",
      "\n",
      "There might have been some grumbling about ‘dealing locally’, but that very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision, commodity, or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood\n",
      "\n",
      "People became enthusiastic; and they began to tick off the days on the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for invitations\n",
      "\n",
      "Before long the invitations began pouring out, and the Hobbiton post-office was blocked, and the Bywater post-office was snowed under, and voluntary assistant postmen were called for\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a constant stream of them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank you, I shall certainly come\n",
      "\n",
      "A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS\n",
      "\n",
      "Even those who had, or pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed inside\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo was busy: writing invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, and making some private preparations of his own\n",
      "\n",
      "From the time of Gandalf ’s arrival he remained hidden from view\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of Bilbo’s front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions\n",
      "\n",
      "A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road, and wide steps and a large white gate were built there\n",
      "\n",
      "The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row, adjoining the field, were intensely interested and generally envied\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden\n",
      "\n",
      "The tents began to go up\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a specially large pavilion, so big that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it, and stood proudly near one end, at the head of the chief table\n",
      "\n",
      "Lanterns were hung on all its branches\n",
      "\n",
      "More promising still (to the hobbits’ mind): an enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field\n",
      "\n",
      "A draught of cooks, from every inn and eating-house for miles around, arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at Bag End\n",
      "\n",
      "Excitement rose to its height\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the weather clouded over\n",
      "\n",
      "That was on Wednesday the eve of the Party\n",
      "\n",
      "Anxiety was intense\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Thursday, September the 22nd, actually dawned\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun began\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety of entertainments rolled into one\n",
      "\n",
      "Practically everybody living near was invited\n",
      "\n",
      "A very few were overlooked by accident, but as they turned up all the same, that did not matter\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people from other parts of the Shire were also asked; and there were even a few from outside the borders\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo met the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave away presents to all and sundry – the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate\n",
      "\n",
      "Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays\n",
      "\n",
      "Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not so lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year was somebody’s birthday, so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week\n",
      "\n",
      "But they never got tired of them\n",
      "\n",
      "On this occasion the presents were unusually good\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbit-children were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating\n",
      "\n",
      "There were toys the like of which they had never seen before, all beautiful and some obviously magical\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before, and had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale, and were of real dwarf-make\n",
      "\n",
      "When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate, there were songs, dances, music, games, and, of course, food and drink\n",
      "\n",
      "There were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper)\n",
      "\n",
      "But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together\n",
      "\n",
      "At other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking – continuously from elevenses until six-thirty, when the fireworks started\n",
      "\n",
      "The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but designed and made by him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was also a generous distribution of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, elf-fountains, goblin-barkers and thunder-claps\n",
      "\n",
      "They were all superb\n",
      "\n",
      "The art of Gandalf improved with age\n",
      "\n",
      "There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices\n",
      "\n",
      "There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces\n",
      "\n",
      "There were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army, and came down again into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes\n",
      "\n",
      "And there was also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf intended\n",
      "\n",
      "The lights went out\n",
      "\n",
      "A great smoke went up\n",
      "\n",
      "It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow at the summit\n",
      "\n",
      "It spouted green and scarlet flames\n",
      "\n",
      "Out flew a red-golden dragon – not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times over the heads of the crowd\n",

      "\n",
      "It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance\n",

      "\n",
      "I always said so,’ was probably the most popular comment\n",

      "Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time he had sat silent beside Bilbo’s empty chair, and ignored all remarks and questions\n",
      "\n",
      "He had enjoyed the joke, of course, even though he had been in the know\n",
      "\n",
      "He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guests\n",
      "\n",
      "But at the same time he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins’ oddities, past and present; but the Sackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath\n",

      "Frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave orders for more wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech, he had been fingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years\n",
      "\n",
      "As he stepped down he slipped it on his finger, and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion, and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he went in\n",
      "\n",
      "He took off his party clothes, folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, and put it away\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments, and fastened round his waist a worn leather belt\n",
      "\n",
      "On it he hung a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard\n",
      "\n",
      "From a locked drawer, smelling of moth-balls, he took out an old cloak and hood\n",
      "\n",
      "They had been locked up as if they were very precious, but they were so patched and weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark green\n",
      "\n",
      "They were rather too large for him\n",
      "\n",
      "He then went into his study, and from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a leather-bound manuscript; and also a large bulky envelope\n",
      "\n",
      "The book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there, already nearly full\n",
      "\n",
      "Into the envelope he slipped his golden ring, and its fine chain, and then sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "At first he put it on the mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I wondered if you would turn up\n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad to find you visible,’ replied the wizard, sitting down in a chair, ‘I wanted to catch you and have a few final words\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, I do,’ said Bilbo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Though that flash was surprising: it quite startled me, let alone the others\n",
      "\n",
      "A little addition of your own, I suppose?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It was\n",
      "\n",
      "You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment\n",
      "\n",
      "And would spoil my joke\n",
      "\n",
      "You are an interfering old busybody,’ laughed Bilbo, ‘but I expect you know best, as usual\n",
      "\n",
      "I do – when I know anything\n",
      "\n",
      "But I don’t feel too sure about this whole affair\n",
      "\n",
      "It has now come to the final point\n",
      "\n",

      "Are you going any further?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, I am\n",

      "Probably a permanent holiday: I don’t expect I shall return\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, I don’t mean to, and I have made all arrangements\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am old, Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts\n",
      "\n",
      "Well-preserved indeed!’ he snorted\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, I feel all thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread\n",
      "\n",
      "That can’t be right\n",

      "Well, I’ve made up my mind, anyway\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell\n",
      "\n",
      "I might find somewhere where I can finish my book\n",

      "‘Yes, I will – two eyes, as often as I can spare them\n",
      "\n",
      "He would come with me, of course, if I asked him\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact he offered to once, just before the party\n",
      "\n",
      "But he does not really want to, yet\n",

      "I want to see the wild country again before I die, and the Mountains; but he is still in love with the Shire, with woods and fields and little rivers\n",

      "I hope he will be happy, when he gets used to being on his own\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s time he was his own master now\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything?’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The ring as well? You agreed to that, you remember\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, er, yes, I suppose so,’ stammered Bilbo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where is it?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In an envelope, if you must know,’ said Bilbo impatiently\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There on the mantelpiece\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, no! Here it is in my pocket!’ He hesitated\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Isn’t that odd now?’ he said softly to himself\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yet after all, why not? Why shouldn’t it stay there?’Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think, Bilbo,’ he said quietly, ‘I should leave it behind\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t you want to?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well yes – and no\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it comes to it, I don’t like parting with it at all, I may say\n",
      "\n",
      "And I don’t really see why I should\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do you want me to?’ he asked, and a curious change came over his voice\n",
      "\n",
      "It was sharp with suspicion and annoyance\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You are always badgering me about my ring; but you have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey\n",
      "\n",
      "No, but I had to badger you,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wanted the truth\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "I was professionally interested in your ring, you may say; and I still am\n",
      "\n",
      "I should like to know where it is, if you go wandering again\n",

      "’Bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "His kindly face grew hard\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why not?’ he cried\n",

      "I have heard his story: how he found it, and how he used it: on his journey, I mean\n",
      "\n",
      "Which story, I wonder,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘If you mean, inventing all that about a “present”, well, I thought the true story much more likely, and I couldn’t see the point of altering it at all\n",

      "The second disappearance of Mr# Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all over the Shire, for a year and a day, and was remembered much longer than that\n",
      "\n",
      "It became a fireside-story for young hobbits; and eventually Mad Baggins, who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold, became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true events were forgotten\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that Bilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at last gone quite mad, and had run off into the Blue\n",
      "\n",
      "There he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic, but hardly an untimely, end\n",
      "\n",
      "The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps he’ll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense,’ they said\n",

      "And to all appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down, but the growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, he at once began to carry on Bilbo’s reputation for oddity\n",
      "\n",
      "He refused to go into mourning; and the next year he gave a party in honour of Bilbo’s hundred-and-twelfth birthday, which he called a Hundred-weight Feast\n",
      "\n",
      "But that was short of the mark, for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at which it snowed food and rained drink, as hobbits say\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving Bilbo’s Birthday Party year after year until they got used to it\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that he did not think Bilbo was dead\n",
      "\n",
      "When they asked: ‘Where is he then?’ he shrugged his shoulders\n",
      "\n",
      "He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends, especially among the younger hobbits (mostly descendants of the Old Took) who had as children been fond of Bilbo and often in and out of Bag End\n",
      "\n",
      "Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger were two of these; but his closest friends were Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real name was Meriadoc, but that was seldom remembered)\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo went tramping over the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry and Pippin suspected that he visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had done\n",
      "\n",
      "As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of good ‘preservation’: outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens\n",

      "‘Some folk have all the luck,’ they said; but it was not until Frodo approached the usually more sober age of fifty that they began to think it queer\n",

      "Frodo himself, after the first shock, found that being his own master and the Mr# Baggins of Bag End was rather pleasant\n",

      "For some years he was quite happy and did not worry much about the future\n",
      "\n",
      "But half unknown to himself the regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was steadily growing\n",
      "\n",
      "He found himself wondering at times, especially in the autumn, about the wild lands, and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his dreams\n",
      "\n",
      "He began to say to himself: ‘Perhaps I shall cross the River myself one day\n",
      "\n",
      "’ To which the other half of his mind always replied: ‘Not yet\n",
      "\n",
      "’So it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftieth birthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he felt was somehow significant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen Bilbo\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo began to feel restless, and the old paths seemed too well-trodden\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at maps, and wondered what lay beyond their edges: maps made in the Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders\n",
      "\n",
      "He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and Merry and his other friends watched him anxiously\n",
      "\n",
      "Often he was seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could\n",
      "\n",
      "Elves, who seldom walked in the Shire, could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening, passing and not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no longer concerned with its troubles\n",
      "\n",
      "There were, however, dwarves on the road in unusual numbers\n",
      "\n",
      "The ancient East–West Road ran through the Shire to its end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had always used it on their way to their mines in the Blue Mountains\n",
      "\n",
      "They were the hobbits’ chief source of news from distant parts – if they wanted any: as a rule dwarves said little and hobbits asked no more\n",
      "\n",
      "But now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries, seeking refuge in the West\n",
      "\n",
      "They were troubled, and some spoke in whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor\n",
      "\n",
      "That name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, like a shadow in the background of their memories; but it was ominous and disquieting\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had been driven out by the White Council only to reappear in greater strength in the old strongholds of Mordor\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dark Tower had been rebuilt, it was said\n",
      "\n",
      "From there the power was spreading far and wide, and away far east and south there were wars and growing fear\n",
      "\n",
      "Orcs were multiplying again in the mountains\n",
      "\n",
      "Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons\n",
      "\n",
      "And there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these, but they had no name\n",
      "\n",
      "Little of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits\n",
      "\n",
      "But even the deafest and most stay-at-home began to hear queer tales; and those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation in The Green Dragon at Bywater, one evening in the spring of Frodo’s fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfortable heart of the Shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire, and opposite him was Ted Sandyman, the miller’s son; and there were various other rustic hobbits listening to their talk\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah,’ said Ted, ‘you do, if you listen\n",
      "\n",
      "But I can hear fireside-tales and children’s stories at home, if I want to\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt you can,’ retorted Sam, ‘and I daresay there’s more truth in some of them than you reckon\n",
      "\n",
      "Who invented the stories anyway? Take dragons now\n",
      "\n",
      "No thank ’ee,’ said Ted, ‘I won’t\n",

      "I heard tell of them when I was a youngster, but there’s no call to believe in them now\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s only one Dragon in Bywater, and that’s Green,’ he said, getting a general laugh\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All right,’ said Sam, laughing with the rest\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But what about these Tree-men, these giants, as you might call them? They do say that one bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors not long back\n",

      "Who’s they?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My cousin Hal for one\n",

      "\n",
      "He saw one\n",

      "Says he did, perhaps\n",
      "\n",
      "Your Hal’s always saying he’s seen things; and maybe he sees things that ain’t there\n",

      "\n",
      "Then I bet it wasn’t an inch\n",
      "\n",
      "What he saw was an elm tree, as like as not\n",
      "\n",
      "But this one was walking, I tell you; and there ain’t no elm tree on the North Moors\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Hal can’t have seen one,’ said Ted\n",
      "\n",
      "There was some laughing and clapping: the audience seemed to think that Ted had scored a point\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All the same,’ said Sam, ‘you can’t deny that others besides our Halfast have seen queer folk crossing the Shire – crossing it, mind you: there are more that are turned back at the borders\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bounders have never been so busy before\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And I’ve heard tell that Elves are moving west\n",
      "\n",
      "They do say they are going to the harbours, out away beyond the White Towers\n",
      "\n",
      "’ Sam waved his arm vaguely: neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the Sea, past the old towers beyond the western borders of the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was an old tradition that away over there stood the Grey Havens, from which at times elven-ships set sail, never to return\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They are sailing, sailing, sailing over the Sea, they are going into the West and leaving us,’ said Sam, half chanting the words, shaking his head sadly and solemnly\n",
      "\n",
      "But Ted laughed\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, that isn’t anything new, if you believe the old tales\n",
      "\n",
      "And I don’t see what it matters to me or you\n",
      "\n",
      "Let them sail! But I warrant you haven’t seen them doing it; nor anyone else in the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I don’t know,’ said Sam thoughtfully\n",
      "\n",
      "He believed he had once seen an Elf in the woods, and still hoped to see more one day\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and half-remembered stories about the Elves as the hobbits knew, had always moved him most deeply\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There are some, even in these parts, as know the Fair Folk and get news of them,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s Mr# Baggins now, that I work for\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about Elves\n",
      "\n",
      "And old Mr# Bilbo knew more: many’s the talk I had with him when I was a little lad\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, they’re both cracked,’ said Ted\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Leastways old Bilbo was cracked, and Frodo’s cracking\n",
      "\n",
      "If that’s where you get your news from, you’ll never want for moonshine\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, friends, I’m off home\n",
      "\n",
      "Your good health!’ He drained his mug and went out noisily\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam sat silent and said no more\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a good deal to think about\n",
      "\n",
      "For one thing, there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden, and he would have a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared\n",
      "\n",
      "The grass was growing fast\n",
      "\n",
      "But Sam had more on his mind than gardening\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while he sighed, and got up and went out\n",
      "\n",
      "It was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was down, and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked home under the early stars through Hobbiton and up the Hill, whistling softly and thoughtfully\n",
      "\n",
      "It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence\n",
      "\n",
      "For three years after the Party he had been away\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he paid Frodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he went off again\n",
      "\n",
      "During the next year or two he had turned up fairly often, coming unexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise\n",
      "\n",
      "He would not discuss his own business and journeys, and seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodo’s health and doings\n",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly his visits had ceased\n",
      "\n",
      "It was over nine years since Frodo had seen or heard of him, and he had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits\n",
      "\n",
      "But that evening, as Sam was walking home and twilight was fading, there came the once familiar tap on the study window\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked hard at one another\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All well eh?’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You look the same as ever, Frodo!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So do you,’ Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked older and more careworn\n",
      "\n",
      "He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide world, and soon they were deep in talk, and they stayed up far into the night\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting with Frodo by the open window of the study\n",
      "\n",
      "A bright fire was on the hearth, but the sun was warm, and the wind was in the South\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything looked fresh, and the new green of spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees’ fingers\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief\n",
      "\n",
      "His hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then, and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer, and his face more lined with care and wisdom; but his eyes were as bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke-rings with the same vigour and delight\n",
      "\n",
      "He was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deep in thought\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that Gandalf had brought\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he broke the silence\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring, Gandalf,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And then you stopped, because you said that such matters were best left until daylight\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t you think you had better finish now? You say the ring is dangerous, far more dangerous than I guess\n",
      "\n",
      "In what way?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In many ways,’ answered the wizard\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is far more powerful than I ever dared to think at first, so powerful that in the end it would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it\n",
      "\n",
      "It would possess him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made, magic rings as you call them, and they were, of course, of various kinds: some more potent and some less\n",
      "\n",
      "The lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but trifles – yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Great Rings, the Rings of Power, they were perilous\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die, but he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues, until at last every minute is a weariness\n",
      "\n",
      "And if he often uses the Ring to make himself invisible, he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks in the twilight under the eye of the Dark Power that rules the Rings\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, sooner or later – later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but neither strength nor good purpose will last – sooner or later the Dark Power will devour him\n",

      "He said that it was “growing on his mind”, and he was always worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blame\n",
      "\n",

      "Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,’ said Frodo, ‘so I have always kept it on its chain\n",

      "\n",
      "‘No one ever found out what had become of Déagol; he was murdered far from home, and his body was cunningly hidden\n",
      "\n",
      "But Sméagol returned alone; and he found that none of his family could see him, when he was wearing the ring\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed it; and he used it to find out secrets, and he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses\n",
      "\n",
      "He became sharp-eyed and keen-eared for all that was hurtful\n",
      "\n",
      "The ring had given him power according to his stature\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not to be wondered at that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when visible) by all his relations\n",
      "\n",
      "They kicked him, and he bit their feet\n",
      "\n",
      "He took to thieving, and going about muttering to himself, and gurgling in his throat\n",
      "\n",
      "So they called him Gollum, and cursed him, and told him to go far away; and his grandmother, desiring peace, expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hole\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He wandered in loneliness, weeping a little for the hardness of the world, and he journeyed up the River, till he came to a stream that flowed down from the mountains, and he went that way\n",
      "\n",
      "He caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw\n",
      "\n",
      "One day it was very hot, and as he was bending over a pool, he felt a burning on the back of his head, and a dazzling light from the water pained his wet eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "He wondered at it, for he had almost forgotten about the Sun\n",
      "\n",
      "Then for the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But as he lowered his eyes, he saw far ahead the tops of the Misty Mountains, out of which the stream came\n",
      "\n",
      "And he thought suddenly: “It would be cool and shady under those mountains\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sun could not watch me there\n",
      "\n",
      "The roots of those mountains must be roots indeed; there must be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning\n",
      "\n",
      "”‘So he journeyed by night up into the highlands, and he found a little cave out of which the dark stream ran; and he wormed his way like a maggot into the heart of the hills, and vanished out of all knowledge\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring went into the shadows with him, and even the maker, when his power had begun to grow again, could learn nothing of it\n",
      "\n",
      "Gollum!’ cried Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Gollum? Do you mean that this is the very Gollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think it is a sad story,’ said the wizard, ‘and it might have happened to others, even to some hobbits that I have known\n",
      "\n",
      "I can’t believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits, however distantly,’ said Frodo with some heat\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What an abominable notion!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is true all the same,’ replied Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘About their origins, at any rate, I know more than hobbits do themselves\n",
      "\n",
      "And even Bilbo’s story suggests the kinship\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a great deal in the background of their minds and memories that was very similar\n",
      "\n",
      "They understood one another remarkably well, very much better than a hobbit would understand, say, a Dwarf, or an Orc, or even an Elf\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of the riddles they both knew, for one thing\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, and of much the same sort\n",
      "\n",
      "And hobbits don’t cheat\n",
      "\n",
      "Gollum meant to cheat all the time\n",
      "\n",
      "He was just trying to put poor Bilbo off his guard\n",
      "\n",
      "And I daresay it amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providing him with an easy victim, but if he lost would not hurt him\n",
      "\n",
      "Only too true, I fear,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But there was something else in it, I think, which you don’t see yet\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Gollum was not wholly ruined\n",
      "\n",
      "He had proved tougher than even one of the Wise would have guessed – as a hobbit might\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little corner of his mind that was still his own, and light came through it, as through a chink in the dark: light out of the past\n",
      "\n",
      "It was actually pleasant, I think, to hear a kindly voice again, bringing up memories of wind, and trees, and sun on the grass, and such forgotten things\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But that, of course, would only make the evil part of him angrier in the end – unless it could be conquered\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless it could be cured\n",
      "\n",
      "’ Gandalf sighed\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Alas! there is little hope of that for him\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet not no hope\n",
      "\n",
      "No, not though he possessed the Ring so long, almost as far back as he can remember\n",
      "\n",
      "For it was long since he had worn it much: in the black darkness it was seldom needed\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly he had never “faded”\n",
      "\n",
      "He is thin and tough still\n",
      "\n",
      "But the thing was eating up his mind, of course, and the torment had become almost unbearable\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All the “great secrets” under the mountains had turned out to be just empty night: there was nothing more to find out, nothing worth doing, only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering\n",
      "\n",
      "He was altogether wretched\n",
      "\n",
      "He hated the dark, and he hated light more: he hated everything, and the Ring most of all\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Surely the Ring was his Precious and the only thing he cared for? But if he hated it, why didn’t he get rid of it, or go away and leave it?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved himself\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not get rid of it\n",
      "\n",
      "He had no will left in the matter\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A Ring of Power looks after itself, Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "It may slip off treacherously, but its keeper never abandons it\n",
      "\n",
      "At most he plays with the idea of handing it on to someone else’s care – and that only at an early stage, when it first begins to grip\n",
      "\n",
      "But as far as I know Bilbo alone in history has ever gone beyond playing, and really done it\n",
      "\n",
      "He needed all my help, too\n",
      "\n",
      "And even so he would never have just forsaken it, or cast it aside\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the Ring itself that decided things\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring left him\n",
      "\n",
      "What, just in time to meet Bilbo?’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Wouldn’t an Orc have suited it better?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is no laughing matter,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not for you\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the strangest event in the whole history of the Ring so far: Bilbo’s arrival just at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There was more than one power at work, Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring was trying to get back to its master\n",
      "\n",
      "It had slipped from Isildur’s hand and betrayed him; then when a chance came it caught poor Déagol, and he was murdered; and after that Gollum, and it had devoured him\n",
      "\n",
      "It could make no further use of him: he was too small and mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never leave his deep pool again\n",
      "\n",
      "So now, when its master was awake once more and sending out his dark thought from Mirkwood, it abandoned Gollum\n",
      "\n",
      "Only to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from the Shire!\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the Ring-maker\n",
      "\n",
      "I can put it no plainer than by saying that Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, and not by its maker\n",
      "\n",
      "In which case you also were meant to have it\n",
      "\n",
      "And that may be an encouraging thought\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Though I am not sure that I understand you\n",
      "\n",
      "But how have you learned all this about the Ring, and about Gollum? Do you really know it all, or are you just guessing still?’Gandalf looked at Frodo, and his eyes glinted\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I knew much and I have learned much,’ he answered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I am not going to give an account of all my doings to you\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of Elendil and Isildur and the One Ring is known to all the Wise\n",
      "\n",
      "Your ring is shown to be that One Ring by the fire-writing alone, apart from any other evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "And when did you discover that?’ asked Frodo, interrupting\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Just now in this room, of course,’ answered the wizard sharply\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I expected to find it\n",
      "\n",
      "I have come back from dark journeys and long search to make that final test\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the last proof, and all is now only too clear\n",
      "\n",
      "Making out Gollum’s part, and fitting it into the gap in the history, required some thought\n",
      "\n",
      "I may have started with guesses about Gollum, but I am not guessing now\n",
      "\n",
      "I know\n",
      "\n",
      "I have seen him\n",
      "\n",
      "You have seen Gollum?’ exclaimed Frodo in amazement\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes\n",
      "\n",
      "The obvious thing to do, of course, if one could\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried long ago; but I have managed it at last\n",
      "\n",
      "Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know that?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not so clearly\n",
      "\n",
      "What I have told you is what Gollum was willing to tell – though not, of course, in the way I have reported it\n",
      "\n",
      "Gollum is a liar, and you have to sift his words\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, he called the Ring his “birthday-present”, and he stuck to that\n",
      "\n",
      "He said it came from his grandmother, who had lots of beautiful things of that kind\n",
      "\n",
      "A ridiculous story\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no doubt that Sméagol’s grandmother was a matriarch, a great person in her way, but to talk of her possessing many Elven-rings was absurd, and as for giving them away, it was a lie\n",
      "\n",
      "But a lie with a grain of truth\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The murder of Déagol haunted Gollum, and he had made up a defence, repeating it to his “Precious” over and over again, as he gnawed bones in the dark, until he almost believed it\n",
      "\n",
      "It was his birthday\n",
      "\n",
      "Déagol ought to have given the ring to him\n",
      "\n",
      "It had obviously turned up just so as to be a present\n",
      "\n",
      "It was his birthday-present, and so on, and on\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I endured him as long as I could, but the truth was desperately important, and in the end I had to be harsh\n",
      "\n",
      "I put the fear of fire on him, and wrung the true story out of him, bit by bit, together with much snivelling and snarling\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought he was misunderstood and ill-used\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he had at last told me his history, as far as the end of the Riddle-game and Bilbo’s escape, he would not say any more, except in dark hints\n",
      "\n",
      "Some other fear was on him greater than mine\n",
      "\n",
      "He muttered that he was going to get his own back\n",
      "\n",
      "People would see if he would stand being kicked, and driven into a hole and then robbed\n",
      "\n",
      "Gollum had good friends now, good friends and very strong\n",
      "\n",
      "They would help him\n",
      "\n",
      "Baggins would pay for it\n",
      "\n",
      "That was his chief thought\n",
      "\n",
      "He hated Bilbo and cursed his name\n",
      "\n",
      "What is more, he knew where he came from\n",
      "\n",
      "But how did he find that out?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, as for the name, Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum himself; and after that it would not be difficult to discover his country, once Gollum came out\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yes, he came out\n",
      "\n",
      "His longing for the Ring proved stronger than his fear of the Orcs, or even of the light\n",
      "\n",
      "After a year or two he left the mountains\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, though still bound by desire of it, the Ring was no longer devouring him; he began to revive a little\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt old, terribly old, yet less timid, and he was mortally hungry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Light, light of Sun and Moon, he still feared and hated, and he always will, I think; but he was cunning\n",
      "\n",
      "He found he could hide from daylight and moonshine, and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his pale cold eyes, and catch small frightened or unwary things\n",
      "\n",
      "He grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air\n",
      "\n",
      "He found his way into Mirkwood, as one would expect\n",
      "\n",
      "Is that where you found him?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I saw him there,’ answered Gandalf, ‘but before that he had wandered far, following Bilbo’s trail\n",
      "\n",
      "It was difficult to learn anything from him for certain, for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats\n",
      "\n",
      "“What had it got in its pocketses?” he said\n",
      "\n",
      "“It wouldn’t say, no precious\n",
      "\n",
      "Little cheat\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a fair question\n",
      "\n",
      "It cheated first, it did\n",
      "\n",
      "It broke the rules\n",
      "\n",
      "We ought to have squeezed it, yes precious\n",
      "\n",
      "And we will, precious!”‘That is a sample of his talk\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t suppose you want any more\n",
      "\n",
      "I had weary days of it\n",
      "\n",
      "But from hints dropped among the snarls I gathered that his padding feet had taken him at last to Esgaroth, and even to the streets of Dale, listening secretly and peering\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the news of the great events went far and wide in Wilderland, and many had heard Bilbo’s name and knew where he came from\n",
      "\n",
      "We had made no secret of our return journey to his home in the West\n",
      "\n",
      "Gollum’s sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted\n",
      "\n",
      "Then why didn’t he track Bilbo further?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why didn’t he come to the Shire?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah,’ said Gandalf, ‘now we come to it\n",
      "\n",
      "I think Gollum tried to\n",
      "\n",
      "He set out and came back westward, as far as the Great River\n",
      "\n",
      "But then he turned aside\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not daunted by the distance, I am sure\n",
      "\n",
      "No, something else drew him away\n",
      "\n",
      "So my friends think, those that hunted him for me\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Wood-elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his trail was still fresh then\n",
      "\n",
      "Through Mirkwood and back again it led them, though they never caught him\n",
      "\n",
      "The wood was full of the rumour of him, dreadful tales even among beasts and birds\n",
      "\n",
      "The Woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad, a ghost that drank blood\n",
      "\n",
      "It climbed trees to find nests; it crept into holes to find the young; it slipped through windows to find cradles\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away\n",
      "\n",
      "It wandered off southwards and passed out of the Wood-elves’ ken, and was lost\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I made a great mistake\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Frodo, and not the first; though I fear it may prove the worst\n",
      "\n",
      "I let the matter be\n",
      "\n",
      "I let him go; for I had much else to think of at that time, and I still trusted the lore of Saruman\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, that was years ago\n",
      "\n",
      "I have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous days\n",
      "\n",
      "The trail was long cold when I took it up again, after Bilbo left here\n",
      "\n",
      "And my search would have been in vain, but for the help that I had from a friend: Aragorn, the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age of the world\n",
      "\n",
      "Together we sought for Gollum down the whole length of Wilderland, without hope, and without success\n",
      "\n",
      "But at last, when I had given up the chase and turned to other paths, Gollum was found\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend returned out of great perils bringing the miserable creature with him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What he had been doing he would not say\n",
      "\n",
      "He only wept and called us cruel, with many a gollum in his throat; and when we pressed him he whined and cringed, and rubbed his long hands, licking his fingers as if they pained him, as if he remembered some old torture\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am afraid there is no possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way, step by step, mile by mile, south, down at last to the Land of Mordor\n",
      "\n",
      "’A heavy silence fell in the room\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo could hear his heart beating\n",
      "\n",
      "Even outside everything seemed still\n",
      "\n",
      "No sound of Sam’s shears could now be heard\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, to Mordor,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Alas! Mordor draws all wicked things, and the Dark Power was bending all its will to gather them there\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring of the Enemy would leave its mark, too, leave him open to the summons\n",
      "\n",
      "And all folk were whispering then of the new Shadow in the South, and its hatred of the West\n",
      "\n",
      "There were his fine new friends, who would help him in his revenge!‘Wretched fool! In that land he would learn much, too much for his comfort\n",
      "\n",
      "And sooner or later as he lurked and pried on the borders he would be caught, and taken – for examination\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the way of it, I fear\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was found he had already been there long, and was on his way back\n",
      "\n",
      "On some errand of mischief\n",
      "\n",
      "But that does not matter much now\n",
      "\n",
      "His worst mischief was done\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, alas! through him the Enemy has learned that the One has been found again\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows where Isildur fell\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows where Gollum found his ring\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it gave long life\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows that it is not one of the Three, for they have never been lost, and they endure no evil\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows that it is not one of the Seven, or the Nine, for they are accounted for\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows that it is the One\n",
      "\n",
      "And he has at last heard, I think, of hobbits and the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Shire – he may be seeking for it now, if he has not already found out where it lies\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, Frodo, I fear that he may even think that the long-unnoticed name of Baggins has become important\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is terrible!’ cried Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Far worse than the worst that I imagined from your hints and warnings\n",
      "\n",
      "O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I to do? For now I am really afraid\n",
      "\n",
      "What am I to do? What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand\n",
      "\n",
      "Pity, and Mercy: not to strike without need\n",
      "\n",
      "And he has been well rewarded, Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "Be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his ownership of the Ring so\n",
      "\n",
      "With Pity\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I am frightened; and I do not feel any pity for Gollum\n",
      "\n",
      "You have not seen him,’ Gandalf broke in\n",
      "\n",

      "‘I can’t understand you\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc, and just an enemy\n",
      "\n",
      "He deserves death\n",
      "\n",
      "Deserves it! I daresay he does\n",
      "\n",
      "Many that live deserve death\n",
      "\n",
      "And some that die deserve life\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement\n",
      "\n",
      "For even the very wise cannot see all ends\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a chance of it\n",
      "\n",
      "And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart tells me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many – yours not least\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts\n",
      "\n",
      "All the same,’ said Frodo, ‘even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum, I wish he had not kept the Ring\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish he had never found it, and that I had not got it! Why did you let me keep it? Why didn’t you make me throw it away, or, or destroy it?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Let you? Make you?’ said the wizard\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Haven’t you been listening to all that I have said? You are not thinking of what you are saying\n",
      "\n",
      "But as for throwing it away, that was obviously wrong\n",
      "\n",
      "These Rings have a way of being found\n",
      "\n",
      "In evil hands it might have done great evil\n",
      "\n",
      "Worst of all, it might have fallen into the hands of the Enemy\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed it certainly would; for this is the One, and he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it to himself\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course, my dear Frodo, it was dangerous for you; and that has troubled me deeply\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was so much at stake that I had to take some risk – though even when I was far away there has never been a day when the Shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as you never used it, I did not think that the Ring would have any lasting effect on you, not for evil, not at any rate for a very long time\n",
      "\n",
      "And you must remember that nine years ago, when I last saw you, I still knew little for certain\n",
      "\n",
      "But why not destroy it, as you say should have been done long ago?’ cried Frodo again\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you had warned me, or even sent me a message, I would have done away with it\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No\n",
      "\n",
      "But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it\n",
      "\n",
      "Try!’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Try now!’Frodo drew the Ring out of his pocket again and looked at it\n",
      "\n",
      "It now appeared plain and smooth, without mark or device that he could see\n",
      "\n",
      "The gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was its colour, how perfect was its roundness\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an admirable thing and altogether precious\n",
      "\n",
      "When he took it out he had intended to fling it from him into the very hottest part of the fire\n",
      "\n",
      "But he found now that he could not do so, not without a great struggle\n",
      "\n",
      "He weighed the Ring in his hand, hesitating, and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him; and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away – but he found that he had put it back in his pocket\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf laughed grimly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily let it go, nor will to damage it\n",
      "\n",
      "And I could not “make” you – except by force, which would break your mind\n",
      "\n",
      "But as for breaking the Ring, force is useless\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge-hammer, it would make no dint in it\n",
      "\n",
      "It cannot be unmade by your hands, or by mine\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Your small fire, of course, would not melt even ordinary gold\n",
      "\n",
      "This Ring has already passed through it unscathed, and even unheated\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is no smith’s forge in this Shire that could change it at all\n",
      "\n",
      "Not even the anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There is only one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin, the Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it, to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever\n",
      "\n",
      "I do really wish to destroy it!’ cried Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Or, well, to have it destroyed\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not made for perilous quests\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I had never seen the Ring! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Such questions cannot be answered,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You may be sure that it was not for any merit that others do not possess: not for power or wisdom, at any rate\n",
      "\n",
      "But you have been chosen, and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have so little of any of these things! You are wise and powerful\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you not take the Ring?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No!’ cried Gandalf, springing to his feet\n",
      "\n",
      "‘With that power I should have power too great and terrible\n",
      "\n",
      "And over me the Ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly\n",
      "\n",
      "’ His eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fire within\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do not tempt me! For I do not wish to become like the Dark Lord himself\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the way of the Ring to my heart is by pity, pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do good\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not tempt me! I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe, unused\n",
      "\n",
      "The wish to wield it would be too great for my strength\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall have such need of it\n",

      "Sunlight streamed back again into the room\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam passed along the path outside whistling\n",

      "\n",
      "But I will always help you\n",
      "\n",

      "The Enemy is moving\n",
      "\n",
      "’There was a long silence\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe, as if lost in thought\n",
      "\n",
      "His eyes seemed closed, but under the lids he was watching Frodo intently\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the hearth, until they filled all his vision, and he seemed to be looking down into profound wells of fire\n",
      "\n",
      "He was thinking of the fabled Cracks of Doom and the terror of the Fiery Mountain\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well!’ said Gandalf at last\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What are you thinking about? Have you decided what to do?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No!’ answered Frodo, coming back to himself out of darkness, and finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of the window he could see the sunlit garden\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Or perhaps, yes\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as I understand what you have said, I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it, at least for the present, whatever it may do to me\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with that purpose,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘But I hope that you may find some other better keeper soon\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the meanwhile it seems that I am a danger, a danger to all that live near me\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot keep the Ring and stay here\n",
      "\n",
      "I ought to leave Bag End, leave the Shire, leave everything and go away\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He sighed\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I should like to save the Shire, if I could – though there have been times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them\n",
      "\n",
      "But I don’t feel like that now\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imagined that as a kind of holiday, a series of adventures like Bilbo’s or better, ending in peace\n",
      "\n",
      "But this would mean exile, a flight from danger into danger, drawing it after me\n",
      "\n",
      "And I suppose I must go alone, if I am to do that and save the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "But I feel very small, and very uprooted, and well – desperate\n",
      "\n",
      "The Enemy is so strong and terrible\n",
      "\n",
      "’He did not tell Gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire to follow Bilbo flamed up in his heart – to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps to find him again\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so strong that it overcame his fear: he could almost have run out there and then down the road without his hat, as Bilbo had done on a similar morning long ago\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear Frodo!’ exclaimed Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hobbits really are amazing creatures, as I have said before\n",

      "You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch\n",
      "\n",
      "I hardly expected to get such an answer, not even from you\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir, though he little thought how important it would prove\n",
      "\n",
      "I am afraid you are right\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring will not be able to stay hidden in the Shire much longer; and for your own sake, as well as for others, you will have to go, and leave the name of Baggins behind you\n",
      "\n",
      "That name will not be safe to have, outside the Shire or in the Wild\n",
      "\n",
      "I will give you a travelling name now\n",
      "\n",
      "When you go, go as Mr# Underhill\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I don’t think you need go alone\n",
      "\n",
      "Not if you know of anyone you can trust, and who would be willing to go by your side – and that you would be willing to take into unknown perils\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you look for a companion, be careful in choosing! And be careful of what you say, even to your closest friends! The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing\n",
      "\n",
      "’Suddenly he stopped as if listening\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo became aware that all was very quiet, inside and outside\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf crept to one side of the window\n",
      "\n",
      "Then with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust a long arm out and downwards\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a squawk, and up came Sam Gamgee’s curly head hauled by one ear\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, well, bless my beard!’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sam Gamgee is it? Now what may you be doing?’\n",

      "‘Lor bless you, Mr# Gandalf, sir!’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nothing! Leastways I was just trimming the grass-border under the window, if you follow me\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t,’ said Gandalf grimly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is some time since I last heard the sound of your shears\n",
      "\n",
      "How long have you been eavesdropping?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Eavesdropping, sir? I don’t follow you, begging your pardon\n",
      "\n",
      "There ain’t no eaves at Bag End, and that’s a fact\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t be a fool! What have you heard, and why did you listen?’ Gandalf ’s eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mr# Frodo, sir!’ cried Sam quaking\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t let him hurt me, sir! Don’t let him turn me into anything unnatural! My old dad would take on so\n",
      "\n",
      "I meant no harm, on my honour, sir!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He won’t hurt you,’ said Frodo, hardly able to keep from laughing, although he was himself startled and rather puzzled\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He knows, as well as I do, that you mean no harm\n",
      "\n",
      "But just you up and answer his questions straight away!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, sir,’ said Sam dithering a little\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I heard a deal that I didn’t rightly understand, about an enemy, and rings, and Mr# Bilbo, sir, and dragons, and a fiery mountain, and – and Elves, sir\n",
      "\n",
      "I listened because I couldn’t help myself, if you know what I mean\n",
      "\n",
      "Lor bless me, sir, but I do love tales of that sort\n",
      "\n",
      "And I believe them too, whatever Ted may say\n",
      "\n",
      "Elves, sir! I would dearly love to see them\n",
      "\n",
      "Couldn’t you take me to see Elves, sir, when you go?’Suddenly Gandalf laughed\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come inside!’ he shouted, and putting out both his arms he lifted the astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings and all, right through the window and stood him on the floor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Take you to see Elves, eh?’ he said, eyeing Sam closely, but with a smile flickering on his face\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So you heard that Mr# Frodo is going away?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I did, sir\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s why I choked: which you heard seemingly\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried not to, sir, but it burst out of me: I was so upset\n",
      "\n",
      "It can’t be helped, Sam,’ said Frodo sadly\n",
      "\n",
      "He had suddenly realized that flying from the Shire would mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell to the familiar comforts of Bag End\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I shall have to go\n",
      "\n",
      "But’ – and here he looked hard at Sam – ‘if you really care about me, you will keep that dead secret\n",
      "\n",
      "See? If you don’t, if you even breathe a word of what you’ve heard here, then I hope Gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass-snakes\n",

      "‘I have thought of something better than that\n",
      "\n",
      "Something to shut your mouth, and punish you properly for listening\n",

      "‘Me, sir!’ cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk\n",

      "\n",
      "‘If you want my advice, make for Rivendell\n",
      "\n",
      "That journey should not prove too perilous, though the Road is less easy than it was, and it will grow worse as the year fails\n",
      "\n",
      "Rivendell!’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very good: I will go east, and I will make for Rivendell\n",

      "\n",
      "A few held the theory – supported by the nods and hints of Mr# Baggins himself – that Frodo’s money was running out: he was going to leave Hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale down in Buckland among his Brandybuck relations\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Good-bye!’ said Frodo, looking at the dark blank windows\n",

      "He waved his hand, and then turned and (following Bilbo, if he had known it) hurried after Peregrin down the garden-path\n",

      "\n",
      "There they halted and adjusted the straps of their packs\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly and breathing hard; his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders, and he had put on his head a tall shapeless felt bag, which he called a hat\n",
      "\n",
      "In the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I pity snails, and all that carry their homes on their backs\n",
      "\n",
      "I could take a lot more yet, sir\n",

      "They went in single file along hedgerows and the borders of coppices, and night fell dark about them\n",
      "\n",
      "In their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings\n",
      "\n",
      "Since they were all hobbits, and were trying to be silent, they made no noise that even hobbits would hear\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed their passing\n",
      "\n",
      "After some time they crossed the Water, west of Hobbiton, by a narrow plank-bridge\n",
      "\n",
      "The stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon, bordered with leaning alder-trees\n",
      "\n",
      "A mile or two further south they hastily crossed the great road from the Brandywine Bridge; they were now in the Tookland and bending south-eastwards they made for the Green Hill Country\n",
      "\n",
      "As they began to climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps in Hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the Water\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land, and was followed by Bywater beside its grey pool\n",
      "\n",
      "When the light of the last farm was far behind, peeping among the trees, Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wonder if I shall ever look down into that valley again,’ he said quietly\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had walked for about three hours they rested\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was clear, cool, and starry, but smoke-like wisps of mist were creeping up the hill-sides from the streams and deep meadows\n",
      "\n",
      "Thin-clad birches, swaying in a light wind above their heads, made a black net against the pale sky\n",
      "\n",
      "They ate a very frugal supper (for hobbits), and then went on again\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon they struck a narrow road, that went rolling up and down, fading grey into the darkness ahead: the road to Woodhall, and Stock, and the Bucklebury Ferry\n",
      "\n",
      "It climbed away from the main road in the Water-valley, and wound over the skirts of the Green Hills towards Woody End, a wild corner of the Eastfarthing\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very dark\n",
      "\n",
      "At first they talked, or hummed a tune softly together, being now far away from inquisitive ears\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they marched on in silence, and Pippin began to lag behind\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, as they began to climb a steep slope, he stopped and yawned\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am so sleepy,’ he said, ‘that soon I shall fall down on the road\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly midnight\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought you liked walking in the dark,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But there is no great hurry\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow; but that leaves us nearly two days more\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll halt at the first likely spot\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind’s in the West,’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If we get to the other side of this hill, we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough, sir\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a dry fir-wood just ahead, if I remember rightly\n",
      "\n",
      "’ Sam knew the land well within twenty miles of Hobbiton, but that was the limit of his geography\n",
      "\n",
      "Just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir-wood\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaving the road they went into the deep resin-scented darkness of the trees, and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir-tree and they sat round it for a while, until they began to nod\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, each in an angle of the great tree’s roots, they curled up in their cloaks and blankets, and were soon fast asleep\n",
      "\n",
      "They set no watch; even Frodo feared no danger yet, for they were still in the heart of the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "A few creatures came and looked at them when the fire had died away\n",
      "\n",
      "A fox passing through the wood on business of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hobbits!’ he thought\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, what next? I have heard of strange doings in this land, but I have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors under a tree\n",
      "\n",
      "Three of them! There’s something mighty queer behind this\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He was quite right, but he never found out any more about it\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning came, pale and clammy\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo woke up first, and found that a tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his neck was stiff\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Walking for pleasure! Why didn’t I drive?’ he thought, as he usually did at the beginning of an expedition\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And all my beautiful feather beds are sold to the Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-roots would do them good\n",
      "\n",

      "‘Wake up, hobbits!’ he cried\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s a beautiful morning\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s beautiful about it?’ said Pippin, peering over the edge of his blanket with one eye\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sam! Get breakfast ready for half-past nine! Have you got the bath-water hot?’Sam jumped up, looking rather bleary\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, sir, I haven’t, sir!’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled him over, and then walked off to the edge of the wood\n",
      "\n",
      "Away eastward the sun was rising red out of the mists that lay thick on the world\n",
      "\n",
      "Touched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea\n",
      "\n",
      "A little below him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared\n",
      "\n",
      "When he returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Water!’ shouted Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where’s the water?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t keep water in my pockets,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We thought you had gone to find some,’ said Pippin, busy setting out the food, and cups\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You had better go now\n",
      "\n",
      "You can come too,’ said Frodo, ‘and bring all the waterbottles\n",
      "\n",
      "’ There was a stream at the foot of the hill\n",
      "\n",
      "They filled their bottles and the small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a few feet over an outcrop of grey stone\n",
      "\n",
      "It was icy cold; and they spluttered and puffed as they bathed their faces and hands\n",
      "\n",
      "When their breakfast was over, and their packs all trussed up again, it was after ten o’clock, and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot\n",
      "\n",
      "They went down the slope, and across the stream where it dived under the road, and up the next slope, and up and down another shoulder of the hills; and by that time their cloaks, blankets, water, food, and other gear already seemed a heavy burden\n",
      "\n",
      "The day’s march promised to be warm and tiring work\n",
      "\n",
      "After some miles, however, the road ceased to roll up and down: it climbed to the top of a steep bank in a weary zig-zagging sort of way, and then prepared to go down for the last time\n",
      "\n",
      "In front of them they saw the lower lands dotted with small clumps of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland haze\n",
      "\n",
      "They were looking across the Woody End towards the Brandywine River\n",
      "\n",
      "The road wound away before them like a piece of string\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The road goes on for ever,’ said Pippin; ‘but I can’t without a rest\n",
      "\n",
      "It is high time for lunch\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He sat down on the bank at the side of the road and looked away east into the haze, beyond which lay the River, and the end of the Shire in which he had spent all his life\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam stood by him\n",
      "\n",
      "His round eyes were wide open – for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a new horizon\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do Elves live in those woods?’ he asked\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not that I ever heard,’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo was silent\n",
      "\n",
      "He too was gazing eastward along the road, as if he had never seen it before\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly:The Road goes ever on and on\n",
      "\n",
      "Down from the door where it began\n",
      "\n",
      "Now far ahead the Road has gone,\n",
      "\n",
      "And I must follow, if I can,\n",
      "\n",
      "Pursuing it with weary feet,\n",
      "\n",
      "Until it joins some larger way,\n",
      "\n",
      "Where many paths and errands meet\n",
      "\n",
      "And whither then? I cannot say\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That sounds like a bit of old Bilbo’s rhyming,’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Or is it one of your imitations? It does not sound altogether encouraging\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It came to me then, as if I was making it up; but I may have heard it long ago\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly it reminds me very much of Bilbo in the last years, before he went away\n",
      "\n",
      "He used often to say there was only one Road; that it was like a great river: its springs were at every doorstep, and every path was its tributary\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out of your door,” he used to say\n",
      "\n",
      "“You step into the Road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there is no knowing where you might be swept off to\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you realize that this is the very path that goes through Mirkwood, and that if you let it, it might take you to the Lonely Mountain or even further and to worse places?” He used to say that on the path outside the front door at Bag End, especially after he had been out for a long walk\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the Road won’t sweep me anywhere for an hour at least,’ said Pippin, unslinging his pack\n",
      "\n",
      "The others followed his example, putting their packs against the bank and their legs out into the road\n",
      "\n",
      "After a rest they had a good lunch, and then more rest\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the land as they went down the hill\n",
      "\n",
      "So far they had not met a soul on the road\n",
      "\n",
      "This way was not much used, being hardly fit for carts, and there was little traffic to the Woody End\n",
      "\n",
      "They had been jogging along again for an hour or more when Sam stopped a moment as if listening\n",
      "\n",
      "They were now on level ground, and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers of the approaching woods\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,’ said Frodo; but even as he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It may not matter much,’ he said apologetically, ‘but I would rather not be seen on the road – by anyone\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sick of my doings being noticed and discussed\n",
      "\n",
      "And if it is Gandalf,’ he added as an afterthought, ‘we can give him a little surprise, to pay him out for being so late\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s get out of sight!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not far from the road\n",
      "\n",
      "There they lay flat\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo hesitated for a second: curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hide\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of hoofs drew nearer\n",
      "\n",
      "Just in time he threw himself down in a patch of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of the great roots\n",
      "\n",
      "Round the corner came a black horse, no hobbit-pony but a full-sized horse; and on it sat a large man, who seemed to crouch in the saddle, wrapped in a great black cloak and hood, so that only his boots in the high stirrups showed below; his face was shadowed and invisible\n",
      "\n",
      "When it reached the tree and was level with Frodo the horse stopped\n",
      "\n",
      "The riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed, as if listening\n",
      "\n",
      "From inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive scent; the head turned from side to side of the road\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of Frodo, and he thought of his Ring\n",
      "\n",
      "He hardly dared to breathe, and yet the desire to get it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt that he had only to slip it on, and then he would be safe\n",
      "\n",
      "The advice of Gandalf seemed absurd\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo had used the Ring\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And I am still in the Shire,’ he thought, as his hand touched the chain on which it hung\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment the rider sat up, and shook the reins\n",
      "\n",
      "The horse stepped forward, walking slowly at first, and then breaking into a quick trot\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider, until he dwindled into the distance\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not be quite sure, but it seemed to him that suddenly, before it passed out of sight, the horse turned aside and went into the trees on the right\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, I call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,’ said Frodo to himself, as he walked towards his companions\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin and Sam had remained flat in the grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo described the rider and his strange behaviour\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can’t say why, but I felt certain he was looking or smelling for me; and also I felt certain that I did not want him to discover me\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve never seen or felt anything like it in the Shire before\n",
      "\n",
      "But what has one of the Big People got to do with us?’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And what is he doing in this part of the world?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There are some Men about,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Down in the Southfarthing they have had trouble with Big People, I believe\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have never heard of anything like this rider\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder where he comes from\n",
      "\n",
      "Begging your pardon,’ put in Sam suddenly, ‘I know where he comes from\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s from Hobbiton that this here black rider comes, unless there’s more than one\n",
      "\n",
      "And I know where he’s going to\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?’ said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why didn’t you speak up before?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have only just remembered, sir\n",
      "\n",
      "It was like this: when I got back to our hole yesterday evening with the key, my dad, he says to me: Hallo, Sam! he says\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought you were away with Mr# Frodo this morning\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s been a strange customer asking for Mr# Baggins of Bag End, and he’s only just gone\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve sent him on to Bucklebury\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that I liked the sound of him\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed mighty put out, when I told him Mr# Baggins had left his old home for good\n",
      "\n",
      "Hissed at me, he did\n",
      "\n",
      "It gave me quite a shudder\n",
      "\n",
      "What sort of a fellow was he? says I to the Gaffer\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know, says he; but he wasn’t a hobbit\n",
      "\n",
      "He was tall and black-like, and he stooped over me\n",
      "\n",
      "I reckon it was one of the Big Folk from foreign parts\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke funny\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I couldn’t stay to hear more, sir, since you were waiting; and I didn’t give much heed to it myself\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gaffer is getting old, and more than a bit blind, and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the Hill and found him taking the air at the end of our Row\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope he hasn’t done no harm, sir, nor me\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gaffer can’t be blamed anyway,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘As a matter of fact I heard him talking to a stranger, who seemed to be inquiring for me, and I nearly went and asked him who it was\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I had, or you had told me about it before\n",
      "\n",
      "I might have been more careful on the road\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, there may be no connexion between this rider and the Gaffer’s stranger,’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We left Hobbiton secretly enough, and I don’t see how he could have followed us\n",
      "\n",
      "What about the smelling, sir?’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And the Gaffer said he was a black chap\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I had waited for Gandalf,’ Frodo muttered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But perhaps it would only have made matters worse\n",
      "\n",
      "Then you know or guess something about this rider?’ said Pippin, who had caught the muttered words\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know, and I would rather not guess,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All right, cousin Frodo! You can keep your secret for the present, if you want to be mysterious\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile what are we to do? I should like a bite and a sup, but somehow I think we had better move on from here\n",
      "\n",
      "Your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I think we will move on now,’ said Frodo; ‘but not on the road – in case that rider comes back, or another follows him\n",
      "\n",
      "We ought to do a good step more today\n",
      "\n",
      "Buckland is still miles away\n",
      "\n",
      "’The shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass, as they started off again\n",
      "\n",
      "They now kept a stone’s throw to the left of the road, and kept out of sight of it as much as they could\n",
      "\n",
      "But this hindered them; for the grass was thick and tussocky, and the ground uneven, and the trees began to draw together into thickets\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs, and evening was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level over which it had run straight for some miles\n",
      "\n",
      "At that point it bent left and went down into the lowlands of the Yale making for Stock; but a lane branched right, winding through a wood of ancient oak-trees on its way to Woodhall\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is the way for us,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "Not far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree: it was still alive and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out round the broken stumps of its long-fallen limbs; but it was hollow, and could be entered by a great crack on the side away from the road\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits crept inside, and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed wood\n",
      "\n",
      "They rested and had a light meal, talking quietly and listening from time to time\n",
      "\n",
      "Twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane\n",
      "\n",
      "The West wind was sighing in the branches\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaves were whispering\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon the road began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk\n",
      "\n",
      "A star came out above the trees in the darkening East before them\n",
      "\n",
      "They went abreast and in step, to keep up their spirits\n",
      "\n",
      "After a time, as the stars grew thicker and brighter, the feeling of disquiet left them, and they no longer listened for the sound of hoofs\n",
      "\n",
      "They began to hum softly, as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk along, especially when they are drawing near to home at night\n",
      "\n",
      "With most hobbits it is a supper-song or a bed-song; but these hobbits hummed a walking-song (though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed)\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo Baggins had made the words, to a tune that was as old as the hills, and taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lanes of the Water-valley and talked about Adventure\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the hearth the fire is red,\n",
      "\n",
      "Beneath the roof there is a bed;\n",

      "But not yet weary are our feet,\n",
      "\n",
      "Still round the corner we may meet\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden tree or standing stone\n",
      "\n",
      "That none have seen but we alone\n",
      "\n",
      "Tree and flower and leaf and grass,\n",

      "And though we pass them by today,\n",
      "\n",
      "Tomorrow we may come this way\n",

      "And take the hidden paths that run\n",

      "Towards the Moon or to the Sun\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple, thorn, and nut and sloe,\n",

      "Then world behind and home ahead,\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll wander back to home and bed\n",

      "Mist and twilight, cloud and shade,\n",
      "\n",
      "Away shall fade! Away shall fade!\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire and lamp, and meat and bread,\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I think I hear hoofs again\n",
      "\n",
      "’They stopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree-shadows, listening\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a sound of hoofs in the lane, some way behind, but coming slow and clear down the wind\n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly and quietly they slipped off the path, and ran into the deeper shade under the oak-trees\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t let us go too far!’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t want to be seen, but I want to see if it is another Black Rider\n",
      "\n",
      "Very well!’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But don’t forget the sniffing!’The hoofs drew nearer\n",
      "\n",
      "They had no time to find any hiding-place better than the general darkness under the trees; Sam and Pippin crouched behind a large tree-bole, while Frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane\n",
      "\n",
      "It showed grey and pale, a line of fading light through the wood\n",
      "\n",
      "Above it the stars were thick in the dim sky, but there was no moon\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of hoofs stopped\n",
      "\n",
      "As Frodo watched he saw something dark pass across the lighter space between two trees, and then halt\n",
      "\n",
      "It looked like the black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow\n",
      "\n",
      "The black shadow stood close to the point where they had left the path, and it swayed from side to side\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling\n",
      "\n",
      "The shadow bent to the ground, and then began to crawl towards him\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more the desire to slip on the Ring came over Frodo; but this time it was stronger than before\n",
      "\n",
      "So strong that, almost before he realized what he was doing, his hand was groping in his pocket\n",
      "\n",
      "But at that moment there came a sound like mingled song and laughter\n",
      "\n",
      "Clear voices rose and fell in the starlit air\n",
      "\n",
      "The black shadow straightened up and retreated\n",
      "\n",
      "It climbed on to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo breathed again\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Elves!’ exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Elves, sir!’ He would have burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices, if they had not pulled him back\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, it is Elves,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘One can meet them sometimes in the Woody End\n",

      "\n",

      "Pippin soon began to feel sleepy, and staggered once or twice; but each time a tall Elf at his side put out his arm and saved him from a fall\n",

      "Sam walked along at Frodo’s side, as if in a dream, with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy\n",
      "\n",
      "The woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and thicker; and as the lane went lower, running down into a fold of the hills, there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the Elves turned aside from the path\n",
      "\n",
      "A green ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on the right; and this they followed as it wound away back up the wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the lower land of the river-valley\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees, and before them lay a wide space of grass, grey under the night\n",
      "\n",
      "On three sides the woods pressed upon it; but eastward the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of the slope, were below their feet\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond, the low lands lay dim and flat under the stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of Woodhall\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices; they seemed to take no further notice of the hobbits\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and drowsiness stole over them\n",
      "\n",
      "The night grew on, and the lights in the valley went out\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin fell asleep, pillowed on a green hillock\n",
      "\n",
      "Away high in the East swung Remmirath, the Netted Stars, and slowly above the mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel of fire\n",
      "\n",
      "Then by some shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil, and there leaned up, as he climbed over the rim of the world, the Swordsman of the Sky, Menelvagor with his shining belt\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elves all burst into song\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come!’ the Elves called to the hobbits\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come! Now is the time for speech and merriment!’Pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "He shivered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There is a fire in the hall, and food for hungry guests,’ said an Elf standing before him\n",
      "\n",
      "At the south end of the greensward there was an opening\n",
      "\n",
      "There the green floor ran on into the wood, and formed a wide space like a hall, roofed by the boughs of trees\n",
      "\n",
      "Their great trunks ran like pillars down each side\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle there was a wood-fire blazing, and upon the tree-pillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elves sat round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks\n",
      "\n",
      "Some went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink; others brought food on heaped plates and dishes\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is poor fare,’ they said to the hobbits; ‘for we are lodging in the greenwood far from our halls\n",
      "\n",
      "If ever you are our guests at home, we will treat you better\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for his mind was filled with the light upon the elf-faces, and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream\n",
      "\n",
      "But he remembered that there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one who is starving; and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught, cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer afternoon\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what he felt or thought that night, though it remained in his memory as one of the chief events of his life\n",
      "\n",
      "The nearest he ever got was to say: ‘Well, sir, if I could grow apples like that, I would call myself a gardener\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean\n",
      "\n",
      "’Frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was chiefly on the words spoken\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew a little of the elf-speech and listened eagerly\n",
      "\n",
      "Now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in their own language\n",
      "\n",
      "They smiled at him and said laughing: ‘Here is a jewel among hobbits!’After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the rest of the night away\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam refused to leave his master\n",
      "\n",
      "When Pippin had gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo’s feet, where at last he nodded and closed his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor\n",
      "\n",
      "They spoke of many things, old and new, and Frodo questioned Gildor much about happenings in the wide world outside the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "The tidings were mostly sad and ominous: of gathering darkness, the wars of Men, and the flight of the Elves\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Frodo asked the question that was nearest to his heart:‘Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?’Gildor smiled\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ he answered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Twice\n",
      "\n",
      "He said farewell to us on this very spot\n",
      "\n",
      "But I saw him once again, far from here\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He would say no more about Bilbo, and Frodo fell silent\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,’ said Gildor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I already know a little, and I can read more in your face and in the thought behind your questions\n",
      "\n",
      "You are leaving the Shire, and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek, or accomplish what you intend, or that you will ever return\n",
      "\n",
      "Is not that so?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is,’ said Frodo; ‘but I thought my going was a secret known only to Gandalf and my faithful Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He looked down at Sam, who was snoring gently\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The secret will not reach the Enemy from us,’ said Gildor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Enemy?’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then you know why I am leaving the Shire?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not know for what reason the Enemy is pursuing you,’ answered Gildor; ‘but I perceive that he is – strange indeed though that seems to me\n",
      "\n",
      "And I warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you, and upon either side\n",
      "\n",
      "You mean the Riders? I feared that they were servants of the Enemy\n",
      "\n",

      "‘Has Gandalf told you nothing?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nothing about such creatures\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I think it is not for me to say more – lest terror should keep you from your journey\n",
      "\n",
      "For it seems to me that you have set out only just in time, if indeed you are in time\n",
      "\n",
      "You must now make haste, and neither stay nor turn back; for the Shire is no longer any protection to you\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than your hints and warnings,’ exclaimed Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I knew that danger lay ahead, of course; but I did not expect to meet it in our own Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "Can’t a hobbit walk from the Water to the River in peace?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But it is not your own Shire,’ said Gildor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Others dwelt here before hobbits were; and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more\n",
      "\n",
      "The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot for ever fence it out\n",
      "\n",
      "I know – and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar\n",
      "\n",
      "What can I do now? My plan was to leave the Shire secretly, and make my way to Rivendell; but now my footsteps are dogged, before ever I get to Buckland\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you should still follow that plan,’ said Gildor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not think the Road will prove too hard for your courage\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you desire clearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know the reason for your flight, and therefore I do not know by what means your pursuers will assail you\n",
      "\n",
      "These things Gandalf must know\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose that you will see him before you leave the Shire?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hope so\n",
      "\n",
      "But that is another thing that makes me anxious\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been expecting Gandalf for many days\n",
      "\n",
      "He was to have come to Hobbiton at the latest two nights ago; but he has never appeared\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I am wondering what can have happened\n",
      "\n",
      "Should I wait for him?’Gildor was silent for a moment\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not like this news,’ he said at last\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is said: Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger\n",
      "\n",
      "The choice is yours: to go or wait\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is also said,’ answered Frodo: ‘Go not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it indeed?’ laughed Gildor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Elves seldom give unguarded advice, for advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all courses may run ill\n",
      "\n",
      "But what would you? You have not told me all concerning yourself; and how then shall I choose better than you? But if you demand advice, I will for friendship’s sake give it\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you should now go at once, without delay; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I also advise this: do not go alone\n",
      "\n",
      "Take such friends as are trusty and willing\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you should be grateful, for I do not give this counsel gladly\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elves have their own labours and their own sorrows, and they are little concerned with the ways of hobbits, or of any other creatures upon earth\n",
      "\n",
      "Our paths cross theirs seldom, by chance or purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "In this meeting there may be more than chance; but the purpose is not clear to me, and I fear to say too much\n",
      "\n",
      "I am deeply grateful,’ said Frodo; ‘but I wish you would tell me plainly what the Black Riders are\n",
      "\n",
      "If I take your advice I may not see Gandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the danger that pursues me\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it not enough to know that they are servants of the Enemy?’ answered Gildor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Flee them! Speak no words to them! They are deadly\n",
      "\n",
      "Ask no more of me! But my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you, Frodo son of Drogo, will know more of these fell things than Gildor Inglorion\n",
      "\n",
      "May Elbereth protect you!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But where shall I find courage?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is what I chiefly need\n",
      "\n",
      "Courage is found in unlikely places,’ said Gildor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Be of good hope! Sleep now! In the morning we shall have gone; but we will send our messages through the lands\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wandering Companies shall know of your journey, and those that have power for good shall be on the watch\n",
      "\n",
      "I name you Elf-friend; and may the stars shine upon the end of your road! Seldom have we had such delight in strangers, and it is fair to hear words of the Ancient Speech from the lips of other wanderers in the world\n",
      "\n",
      "’Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as Gildor finished speaking\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will sleep now,’ he said; and the Elf led him to a bower beside Pippin, and he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber\n",

      "Chapter 4A SHORT CUT TO MUSHROOMSIn the morning Frodo woke refreshed\n",
      "\n",
      "He was lying in a bower made by a living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground; his bed was of fern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was shining through the fluttering leaves, which were still green upon the tree\n",
      "\n",
      "He jumped up and went out\n",

      "‘What is the plan for today?’ asked Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,’ answered Frodo, and gave his attention to the food\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders?’ asked Pippin cheerfully\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of them did not seem very alarming to him\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "He was a funny customer and asking funny questions\n",

      "But perhaps you’ll come along inside, and we’ll pass the news more comfortable\n",

      "’ At the name Baggins the farmer started, and gave Frodo a sharp glance\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment Frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused, and that the dogs would be told to see him off\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs# Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug, and filled four large mugs\n",

      "Sam sipped his beer suspiciously\n",

      "After a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects (which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down his mug and looked at them all in turn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, Mr# Peregrin,’ he said, ‘where might you be coming from, and where might you be going to? Were you coming to visit me? For, if so, you had gone past my gate without my seeing you\n",

      "Well, no,’ answered Pippin\n",

      "‘To tell you the truth, since you have guessed it, we got into the lane from the other end: we had come over your fields\n",
      "\n",

      "What do you think that funny customer asked me?’They waited anxiously for him to go on\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well,’ the farmer continued, approaching his point with slow relish, ‘he came riding on a big black horse in at the gate, which happened to be open, and right up to my door\n",
      "\n",
      "All black he was himself, too, and cloaked and hooded up, as if he did not want to be known\n",

      "“This lane don’t lead anywhere, and wherever you may be going, your quickest way will be back to the road\n",
      "\n",
      "” I didn’t like the looks of him; and when Grip came out, he took one sniff and let out a yelp as if he had been stung: he put down his tail and bolted off howling\n",
      "\n",
      "The black fellow sat quite still\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ “I come from yonder,” he said, slow and stiff-like, pointing back west, over my fields, if you please\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you seen Baggins?” he asked in a queer voice, and bent down towards me\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not see any face, for his hood fell down so low; and I felt a sort of shiver down my back\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I called the dogs, but he swung off, and rode through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder\n",

      "\n",
      "Maybe there is some that want to know what has become of the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?’Frodo said nothing: the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, Mr# Frodo,’ Maggot went on, ‘I’m glad that you’ve had the sense to come back to Buckland\n",
      "\n",

      "Its chief village was Bucklebury, clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall\n",
      "\n",
      "The people in the Marish were friendly with the Bucklanders, and the authority of the Master of the Hall (as the head of the Brandybuck family was called) was still acknowledged by the farmers between Stock and Rushey\n",
      "\n",
      "But most of the folk of the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as peculiar, half foreigners as it were\n",
      "\n",
      "Though, as a matter of fact, they were not very different from the other hobbits of the Four Farthings\n",
      "\n",
      "Except in one point: they were fond of boats, and some of them could swim\n",
      "\n",
      "Their land was originally unprotected from the East; but on that side they had built a hedge: the High Hay\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been planted many generations ago, and was now thick and tall, for it was constantly tended\n",
      "\n",
      "It ran all the way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loop curving away from the river, to Haysend (where the Withywindle flowed out of the Forest into the Brandywine): well over twenty miles from end to end\n",
      "\n",
      "But, of course, it was not a complete protection\n",
      "\n",
      "The Forest drew close to the hedge in many places\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark, and that also was not usual in the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "The ferry-boat moved slowly across the water\n",
      "\n",
      "The Buckland shore drew nearer\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river before\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his old life lay behind in the mists, dark adventure lay in front\n",
      "\n",
      "He scratched his head, and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr# Frodo could have gone on living quietly at Bag End\n",
      "\n",
      "The four hobbits stepped off the ferry\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry was tying it up, and Pippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (who had been looking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper:‘Look back, Mr# Frodo! Do you see anything?’On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make out a figure: it looked like a dark black bundle left behind\n",
      "\n",
      "But as they looked it seemed to move and sway this way and that, as if searching the ground\n",
      "\n",
      "It then crawled, or went crouching, back into the gloom beyond the lamps\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What in the Shire is that?’ exclaimed Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Something that is following us,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But don’t ask any more now! Let’s get away at once!’ They hurried up the path to the top of the bank, but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist, and nothing could be seen\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thank goodness you don’t keep any boats on the west-bank!’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Can horses cross the river?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They can go ten miles north to Brandywine Bridge – or they might swim,’ answered Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Though I never heard of any horse swimming the Brandywine\n",
      "\n",
      "But what have horses to do with it?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’ll tell you later\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s get indoors and then we can talk\n",
      "\n",
      "All right! You and Pippin know your way; so I’ll just ride on and tell Fatty Bolger that you are coming\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll see about supper and things\n",
      "\n",
      "We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,’ said Frodo; ‘but we could do with another\n",
      "\n",
      "You shall have it! Give me that basket!’ said Merry, and rode ahead into the darkness\n",
      "\n",
      "It was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodo’s new house at Crickhollow\n",
      "\n",
      "They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left, and on the outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland that ran south from the Bridge\n",
      "\n",
      "Half a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on their right\n",
      "\n",
      "This they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and down into the country\n",
      "\n",
      "At last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could be seen of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer hedge\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an out-of-the-way corner of the country, and there were no other dwellings close by\n",
      "\n",
      "You could get in and out without being noticed\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been built a long while before by the Brandybucks, for the use of guests, or members of the family that wished to escape from the crowded life of Brandy Hall for a time\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an old-fashioned countrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: it was long and low, with no upper storey; and it had a roof of turf, round windows, and a large round door\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked up the green path from the gate no light was visible; the windows were dark and shuttered\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo knocked on the door, and Fatty Bolger opened it\n",
      "\n",
      "A friendly light streamed out\n",
      "\n",
      "They slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light inside\n",
      "\n",
      "They were in a wide hall with doors on either side; in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the house\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, what do you think of it?’ asked Merry coming up the passage\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We have done our best in a short time to make it look like home\n",
      "\n",
      "After all Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday\n",
      "\n",
      "’Frodo looked round\n",
      "\n",
      "It did look like home\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of his own favourite things – or Bilbo’s things (they reminded him sharply of him in their new setting) – were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at Bag End\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a pleasant, comfortable, welcoming place; and he found himself wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble; and he wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave them so soon, indeed at once\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet that would have to be done that very night, before they all went to bed\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s delightful!’ he said with an effort\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hardly feel that I have moved at all\n",
      "\n",
      "’The travellers hung up their cloaks, and piled their packs on the floor\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end\n",
      "\n",
      "Firelight came out, and a puff of steam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A bath!’ cried Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘O blessed Meriadoc!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Which order shall we go in?’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Eldest first, or quickest first? You’ll be last either way, Master Peregrin\n",
      "\n",
      "Trust me to arrange things better than that!’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We can’t begin life at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths\n",
      "\n",
      "In that room there are three tubs, and a copper full of boiling water\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also towels, mats and soap\n",
      "\n",
      "Get inside, and be quick!’Merry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage, and busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper\n",
      "\n",
      "Snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound of splashing and wallowing\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice of Pippin was suddenly lifted up above the others in one of Bilbo’s favourite bath-songs\n",
      "\n",
      "Sing hey! for the bath at close of day\n",
      "\n",
      "that washes the weary mud away!\n",
      "\n",
      "A loon is he that will not sing:\n",
      "\n",
      "O! Water Hot is a noble thing!\n",
      "\n",
      "O! Sweet is the sound of falling rain,\n",
      "\n",
      "and the brook that leaps from hill to plain;\n",
      "\n",
      "but better than rain or rippling streams\n",
      "\n",
      "is Water Hot that smokes and steams\n",
      "\n",
      "O! Water cold we may pour at need\n",
      "\n",
      "down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed;\n",
      "\n",
      "but better is Beer, if drink we lack,\n",
      "\n",
      "and Water Hot poured down the back\n",
      "\n",
      "O! Water is fair that leaps on high\n",
      "\n",
      "in a fountain white beneath the sky;\n",
      "\n",
      "but never did fountain sound so sweet\n",
      "\n",
      "as splashing Hot Water with my feet!\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a terrific splash, and a shout of Whoa! from Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared that a lot of Pippin’s bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on high\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry went to the door: ‘What about supper and beer in the throat?’ he called\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo came out drying his hair\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s so much water in the air that I’m coming into the kitchen to finish,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Lawks!’ said Merry, looking in\n",
      "\n",
      "The stone floor was swimming\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat, Peregrin,’ he said\n",

      "\n",
      "’They had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I suppose you three won’t want mushrooms again?’ said Fredegar without much hope\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes we shall!’ cried Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They’re mine!’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Given to me by Mrs# Maggot, a queen among farmers’ wives\n",
      "\n",
      "Take your greedy hands away, and I’ll serve them\n",
      "\n",
      "’Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the greediest likings of Big People\n",
      "\n",
      "A fact which partly explains young Frodo’s long expeditions to the renowned fields of the Marish, and the wrath of the injured Maggot\n",
      "\n",
      "On this occasion there was plenty for all, even according to hobbit standards\n",
      "\n",
      "There were also many other things to follow, and when they had finished even Fatty Bolger heaved a sigh of content\n",
      "\n",
      "They pushed back the table, and drew chairs round the fire\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We’ll clear up later,’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now tell me all about it! I guess that you have been having adventures, which was not quite fair without me\n",
      "\n",
      "I want a full account; and most of all I want to know what was the matter with old Maggot, and why he spoke to me like that\n",
      "\n",
      "He sounded almost as if he was scared, if that is possible\n",
      "\n",
      "We have all been scared,’ said Pippin after a pause, in which Frodo stared at the fire and did not speak\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You would have been, too, if you had been chased for two days by Black Riders\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And what are they?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Black figures riding on black horses,’ answered Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If Frodo won’t talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He then gave a full account of their journey from the time when they left Hobbiton\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam gave various supporting nods and exclamations\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo remained silent\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I should think you were making it all up,’ said Merry, ‘if I had not seen that black shape on the landing-stage – and heard the queer sound in Maggot’s voice\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you make of it all, Frodo?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Cousin Frodo has been very close,’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But the time has come for him to open out\n",
      "\n",
      "So far we have been given nothing more to go on than Farmer Maggot’s guess that it has something to do with old Bilbo’s treasure\n",
      "\n",
      "That was only a guess,’ said Frodo hastily\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Maggot does not know anything\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Maggot is a shrewd fellow,’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A lot goes on behind his round face that does not come out in his talk\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve heard that he used to go into the Old Forest at one time, and he has the reputation of knowing a good many strange things\n",
      "\n",
      "But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think his guess good or bad\n",
      "\n",
      "I think,’ answered Frodo slowly, ‘that it was a good guess, as far as it goes\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a connexion with Bilbo’s old adventures, and the Riders are looking, or perhaps one ought to say searching, for him or for me\n",
      "\n",
      "I also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and that I am not safe here or anywhere else\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He looked round at the windows and walls, as if he was afraid they would suddenly give way\n",
      "\n",
      "The others looked at him in silence, and exchanged meaning glances among themselves\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s coming out in a minute,’ whispered Pippin to Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry nodded\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well!’ said Frodo at last, sitting up and straightening his back, as if he had made a decision\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can’t keep it dark any longer\n",
      "\n",
      "I have got something to tell you all\n",
      "\n",
      "But I don’t know quite how to begin\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I could help you,’ said Merry quietly, ‘by telling you some of it myself\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?’ said Frodo, looking at him anxiously\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Just this, my dear old Frodo: you are miserable, because you don’t know how to say good-bye\n",
      "\n",
      "You meant to leave the Shire, of course\n",
      "\n",
      "But danger has come on you sooner than you expected, and now you are making up your mind to go at once\n",
      "\n",
      "And you don’t want to\n",
      "\n",
      "We are very sorry for you\n",
      "\n",
      "’Frodo opened his mouth and shut it again\n",
      "\n",
      "His look of surprise was so comical that they laughed\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Dear old Frodo!’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Did you really think you had thrown dust in all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful or clever enough for that! You have obviously been planning to go and saying farewell to all your haunts all this year since April\n",
      "\n",
      "We have constantly heard you muttering: “Shall I ever look down into that valley again, I wonder”, and things like that\n",
      "\n",
      "And pretending that you had come to the end of your money, and actually selling your beloved Bag End to those Sackville-Bagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "Good heavens!’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I thought I had been both careful and clever\n",
      "\n",

      "‘Oh no!’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t worry about that! The secret won’t keep for long, of course; but at present it is, I think, only known to us conspirators\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, you must remember that we know you well, and are often with you\n",
      "\n",
      "We can usually guess what you are thinking\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew Bilbo, too\n",
      "\n",
      "To tell you the truth, I have been watching you rather closely ever since he left\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought you would go after him sooner or later; indeed I expected you to go sooner, and lately we have been very anxious\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been terrified that you might give us the slip, and go off suddenly, all on your own like he did\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, and done a good deal of planning on our own account\n",
      "\n",
      "You are not going to escape so easily!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I must go,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It cannot be helped, dear friends\n",
      "\n",
      "It is wretched for us all, but it is no use your trying to keep me\n",

      "Since you have guessed so much, please help me and do not hinder me!’\n",
      "\n",

      "Merry and I are coming with you\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam is an excellent fellow, and would jump down a dragon’s throat to save you, if he did not trip over his own feet; but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous adventure\n",

      "My dear and most beloved hobbits!’ said Frodo deeply moved\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I could not allow it\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided that long ago, too\n",
      "\n",
      "You speak of danger, but you do not understand\n",
      "\n",
      "This is no treasure-hunt, no there-and-back journey\n",
      "\n",
      "I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril\n",

      "Of course we understand,’ said Merry firmly\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Yes, the Ring,’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear old hobbit, you don’t allow for the inquisitiveness of friends\n",
      "\n",
      "I have known about the existence of the Ring for years – before Bilbo went away, in fact; but since he obviously regarded it as secret, I kept the knowledge in my head, until we formed our conspiracy\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not know Bilbo, of course, as well as I know you; I was too young, and he was also more careful – but he was not careful enough\n",
      "\n",

      "Suddenly in the distance the S\n",
      "\n",
      "-B\n",

      "\n",
      "‘After that I kept my eyes open\n",

      "In fact, I confess that I spied\n",

      "I must be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen the old fellow’s secret book\n",

      "It was not at Bag End\n",
      "\n",
      "He must have taken it away\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, as I was saying,’ Merry proceeded, ‘I kept my knowledge to myself, till this spring when things got serious\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we formed our conspiracy; and as we were serious, too, and meant business, we have not been too scrupulous\n",
      "\n",
      "You are not a very easy nut to crack, and Gandalf is worse\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator, I can produce him\n",
      "\n",
      "Where is he?’ said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Step forward, Sam!’ said Merry; and Sam stood up with a face scarlet up to the ears\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Here’s our collector of information! And he collected a lot, I can tell you, before he was finally caught\n",
      "\n",
      "After which, I may say, he seemed to regard himself as on parole, and dried up\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam!’ cried Frodo, feeling that amazement could go no further, and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry, amused, relieved, or merely foolish\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, sir!’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant no wrong to you, Mr# Frodo, nor to Mr# Gandalf for that matter\n",
      "\n",
      "He has some sense, mind you; and when you said go alone, he said no! take someone as you can trust\n",
      "\n",
      "But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam looked at him unhappily\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It all depends on what you want,’ put in Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin – to the bitter end\n",
      "\n",
      "And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours – closer than you keep it yourself\n",
      "\n",
      "But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a word\n",
      "\n",
      "We are your friends, Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway: there it is\n",
      "\n",
      "We know most of what Gandalf has told you\n",
      "\n",
      "We know a good deal about the Ring\n",
      "\n",
      "We are horribly afraid – but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds\n",
      "\n",
      "And after all, sir,’ added Sam, ‘you did ought to take the Elves’ advice\n",
      "\n",
      "Gildor said you should take them as was willing, and you can’t deny it\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t deny it,’ said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now grinning\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t deny it, but I’ll never believe you are sleeping again, whether you snore or not\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall kick you hard to make sure\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You are a set of deceitful scoundrels!’ he said, turning to the others\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But bless you!’ he laughed, getting up and waving his arms, ‘I give in\n",
      "\n",
      "I will take Gildor’s advice\n",
      "\n",
      "If the danger were not so dark, I should dance for joy\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier than I have felt for a long time\n",
      "\n",
      "I had dreaded this evening\n",
      "\n",
      "Good! That’s settled\n",
      "\n",
      "Three cheers for Captain Frodo and company!’ they shouted; and they danced round him\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry and Pippin began a song, which they had apparently got ready for the occasion\n",
      "\n",
      "It was made on the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo on his adventure long ago, and went to the same tune:Farewell we call to hearth and hall!\n",
      "\n",
      "Though wind may blow and rain may fall,\n",
      "\n",
      "We must away ere break of day\n",
      "\n",
      "Far over wood and mountain tall\n",
      "\n",
      "To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell\n",
      "\n",
      "In glades beneath the misty fell,\n",
      "\n",
      "Through moor and waste we ride in haste,\n",
      "\n",
      "And whither then we cannot tell\n",
      "\n",
      "With foes ahead, behind us dread,\n",
      "\n",
      "Beneath the sky shall be our bed,\n",
      "\n",
      "Until at last our toil be passed,\n",
      "\n",
      "Our journey done, our errand sped\n",
      "\n",
      "We must away! We must away!\n",
      "\n",
      "We ride before the break of day!\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very good!’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But in that case there are a lot of things to do before we go to bed – under a roof, for tonight at any rate\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! That was poetry!’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you really mean to start before the break of day?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know,’ answered Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I fear those Black Riders, and I am sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially in a place to which it is known I was going\n",
      "\n",
      "Also Gildor advised me not to wait\n",
      "\n",
      "But I should very much like to see Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "I could see that even Gildor was disturbed when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared\n",
      "\n",
      "It really depends on two things\n",
      "\n",
      "How soon could the Riders get to Bucklebury? And how soon could we get off? It will take a good deal of preparation\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer to the second question,’ said Merry, ‘is that we could get off in an hour\n",
      "\n",
      "I have prepared practically everything\n",
      "\n",
      "There are five ponies in a stable across the fields; stores and tackle are all packed, except for a few extra clothes, and the perishable food\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But what about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That all depends on what you think the Riders would do, if they found you here,’ answered Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They could have reached here by now, of course, if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the riverbank, just this side of the Bridge\n",
      "\n",
      "The gate-guards would not let them through by night, though they might break through\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in the daylight they would try to keep them out, I think, at any rate until they got a message through to the Master of the Hall – for they would not like the look of the Riders, and would certainly be frightened by them\n",
      "\n",
      "But, of course, Buckland cannot resist a determined attack for long\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is possible that in the morning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr# Baggins would be let through\n",
      "\n",
      "It is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at Crickhollow\n",
      "\n",
      "’Frodo sat for a while in thought\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have made up my mind,’ he said finally\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am not going by road: it would be safer to wait here than that\n",
      "\n",
      "If I go through the North-gate my departure from Buckland will be known at once, instead of being secret for several days at least, as it might be\n",
      "\n",
      "And what is more, the Bridge and the East Road near the borders will certainly be watched, whether any Rider gets into Buckland or not\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t know how many there are; but there are at least two, and possibly more\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction\n",
      "\n",
      "But that can only mean going into the Old Forest!’ said Fredegar horrified\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You can’t be thinking of doing that\n",
      "\n",
      "It is quite as dangerous as Black Riders\n",
      "\n",
      "Not quite,’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It sounds very desperate, but I believe Frodo is right\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the only way of getting off without being followed at once\n",
      "\n",
      "With luck we might get a considerable start\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But you won’t have any luck in the Old Forest,’ objected Fredegar\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No one ever has luck in there\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll get lost\n",
      "\n",
      "People don’t go in there\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yes they do!’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Brandybucks go in – occasionally when the fit takes them\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a private entrance\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo went in once, long ago\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been in several times: usually in daylight, of course, when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, do as you think best!’ said Fredegar\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am more afraid of the Old Forest than of anything I know about: the stories about it are a nightmare; but my vote hardly counts, as I am not going on the journey\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long\n",
      "\n",
      "’Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire, nor to see what lay outside it\n",
      "\n",
      "His family came from the Eastfarthing, from Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the Brandywine Bridge\n",
      "\n",
      "His task, according to the original plans of the conspirators, was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk, and to keep up as long as possible the pretence that Mr# Baggins was still living at Crickhollow\n",
      "\n",
      "He had even brought along some old clothes of Frodo’s to help him in playing the part\n",
      "\n",
      "They little thought how dangerous that part might prove\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Excellent!’ said Frodo, when he understood the plan\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We could not have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know whether these Riders can read or not, of course, but I should not have dared to risk a written message, in case they got in and searched the house\n",
      "\n",
      "But if Fatty is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we have gone, that decides me\n",
      "\n",
      "I am going into the Old Forest first thing tomorrow\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that’s that,’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘On the whole I would rather have our job than Fatty’s – waiting here till Black Riders come\n",
      "\n",
      "You wait till you are well inside the Forest,’ said Fredegar\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You’ll wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s no good arguing about it any more,’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We have still got to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing, before we get to bed\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall call you all before the break of day\n",
      "\n",
      "’When at last he had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for some time\n",
      "\n",
      "His legs ached\n",
      "\n",
      "He was glad that he was riding in the morning\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually he fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled trees\n",
      "\n",
      "Down below among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he heard a noise in the distance\n",
      "\n",
      "At first he thought it was a great wind coming over the leaves of the forest\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he knew that it was not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he found he was out in the open\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no trees after all\n",
      "\n",
      "He was on a dark heath, and there was a strange salt smell in the air\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking up he saw before him a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge\n",
      "\n",
      "A great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the Sea\n",
      "\n",
      "He started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower: but suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a noise of thunder\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 6THE OLD FORESTFrodo woke suddenly\n",
      "\n",
      "It was still dark in the room\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry was standing there with a candle in one hand, and banging on the door with the other\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All right! What is it?’ said Frodo, still shaken and bewildered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is it!’ cried Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is time to get up\n",
      "\n",
      "It is half past four and very foggy\n",
      "\n",
      "Come on! Sam is already getting breakfast ready\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Pippin is up\n",
      "\n",
      "I am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetch the one that is to be the baggage-carrier\n",
      "\n",
      "Wake that sluggard Fatty! At least he must get up and see us off\n",
      "\n",
      "’Soon after six o’clock the five hobbits were ready to start\n",
      "\n",
      "Fatty Bolger was still yawning\n",
      "\n",
      "They stole quietly out of the house\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry went in front leading a laden pony, and took his way along a path that went through a spinney behind the house, and then cut across several fields\n",
      "\n",
      "The leaves of trees were glistening, and every twig was dripping; the grass was grey with cold dew\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was still, and far-away noises seemed near and clear: fowls chattering in a yard, someone closing a door of a distant house\n",
      "\n",
      "In their shed they found the ponies: sturdy little beasts of the kind loved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for a long day’s work\n",
      "\n",
      "They mounted, and soon they were riding off into the mist, which seemed to open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them\n",
      "\n",
      "After riding for about an hour, slowly and without talking, they saw the Hedge looming suddenly ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "It was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How are you going to get through this?’ asked Fredegar\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Follow me!’ said Merry, ‘and you will see\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He turned to the left along the Hedge, and soon they came to a point where it bent inwards, running along the lip of a hollow\n",
      "\n",
      "A cutting had been made, at some distance from the Hedge, and went sloping gently down into the ground\n",
      "\n",
      "It had walls of brick at the sides, which rose steadily, until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep under the Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Fatty Bolger halted\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Good-bye, Frodo!’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wish you were not going into the Forest\n",
      "\n",
      "I only hope you will not need rescuing before the day is out\n",
      "\n",
      "But good luck to you – today and every day!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest, I shall be lucky,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East Road: we shall soon be back on it and going as fast as we can\n",
      "\n",
      "’ ‘Good-bye!’ they cried, and rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar’s sight into the tunnel\n",
      "\n",
      "It was dark and damp\n",
      "\n",
      "At the far end it was closed by a gate of thick-set iron bars\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry got down and unlocked the gate, and when they had all passed through he pushed it to again\n",
      "\n",
      "It shut with a clang, and the lock clicked\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound was ominous\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There!’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You have left the Shire, and are now outside, and on the edge of the Old Forest\n",
      "\n",
      "Are the stories about it true?’ asked Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know what stories you mean,’ Merry answered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you mean the old bogey-stories Fatty’s nurses used to tell him, about goblins and wolves and things of that sort, I should say no\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate I don’t believe them\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Forest is queer\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything in it is very much more alive, more aware of what is going on, so to speak, than things are in the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "And the trees do not like strangers\n",
      "\n",
      "They watch you\n",
      "\n",
      "They are usually content merely to watch you, as long as daylight lasts, and don’t do much\n",
      "\n",
      "Occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch, or stick a root out, or grasp at you with a long trailer\n",
      "\n",
      "But at night things can be most alarming, or so I am told\n",
      "\n",
      "I have only once or twice been in here after dark, and then only near the hedge\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought all the trees were whispering to each other, passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language; and the branches swayed and groped without any wind\n",
      "\n",
      "They do say the trees do actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them in\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact long ago they attacked the Hedge: they came and planted themselves right by it, and leaned over it\n",
      "\n",
      "But the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees, and made a great bonfire in the Forest, and burned all the ground in a long strip east of the Hedge\n",
      "\n",
      "After that the trees gave up the attack, but they became very unfriendly\n",
      "\n",
      "There is still a wide bare space not far inside where the bonfire was made\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Is it only the trees that are dangerous?’ asked Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There are various queer things living deep in the Forest, and on the far side,’ said Merry, ‘or at least I have heard so; but I have never seen any of them\n",
      "\n",
      "But something makes paths\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks; but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer fashion\n",
      "\n",
      "Not far from this tunnel there is, or was for a long time, the beginning of quite a broad path leading to the Bonfire Glade, and then on more or less in our direction, east and a little north\n",
      "\n",
      "That is the path I am going to try and find\n",
      "\n",
      "’The hobbits now left the tunnel-gate and rode across the wide hollow\n",
      "\n",
      "On the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the Forest, a hundred yards and more beyond the Hedge; but it vanished as soon as it brought them under the trees\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back they could see the dark line of the Hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking ahead they could see only tree-trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes: straight or bent, twisted, leaning, squat or slender, smooth or gnarled and branched; and all the stems were green or grey with moss and slimy, shaggy growths\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You had better lead on and find that path,’ Frodo said to him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t let us lose one another, or forget which way the Hedge lies!’They picked a way among the trees, and their ponies plodded along, carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no undergrowth\n",
      "\n",
      "The ground was rising steadily, and as they went forward it seemed that the trees became taller, darker, and thicker\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no sound, except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still leaves\n",
      "\n",
      "For the moment there was no whispering or movement among the branches; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched with disapproval, deepening to dislike and even enmity\n",
      "\n",
      "The feeling steadily grew, until they found themselves looking up quickly, or glancing back over their shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow\n",
      "\n",
      "There was not as yet any sign of a path, and the trees seemed constantly to bar their way\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it any longer, and without warning let out a shout\n",
      "\n",

      "Just let me pass through, will you!’The others halted startled; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become more crowded and more watchful than before\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I should not shout, if I were you,’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It does more harm than good\n",
      "\n",
      "’Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through, and if he had been right to make the others come into this abominable wood\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry was looking from side to side, and seemed already uncertain which way to go\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin noticed it\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It has not taken you long to lose us,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "But at that moment Merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, well!’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘These trees do shift\n",
      "\n",
      "There is the Bonfire Glade in front of us (or I hope so), but the path to it seems to have moved away!’The light grew clearer as they went forward\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly they came out of the trees and found themselves in a wide circular space\n",
      "\n",
      "There was sky above them, blue and clear to their surprise, for down under the Forest-roof they had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was not, however, high enough yet to shine down into the clearing, though its light was on the tree-tops\n",
      "\n",
      "The leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges of the glade, enclosing it with an almost solid wall\n",
      "\n",
      "No tree grew there, only rough grass and many tall plants: stalky and faded hemlocks and wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes, and rampant nettles and thistles\n",
      "\n",
      "A dreary place: but it seemed a charming and cheerful garden after the close Forest\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broadening daylight in the sky\n",
      "\n",
      "At the far side of the glade there was a break in the wall of trees, and a clear path beyond it\n",
      "\n",
      "They could see it running on into the wood, wide in places and open above, though every now and again the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs\n",
      "\n",
      "Up this path they rode\n",
      "\n",
      "They were still climbing gently, but they now went much quicker, and with better heart; for it seemed to them that the Forest had relented, and was going to let them pass unhindered after all\n",
      "\n",
      "But after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy\n",
      "\n",
      "The trees drew close again on either side, and they could no longer see far ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "Now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on them\n",
      "\n",
      "So silent was it that the fall of their ponies’ hoofs, rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots, seemed to thud in their ears\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them, but his voice sank to a murmur\n",
      "\n",
      "O! Wanderers in the shadowed land\n",
      "\n",
      "despair not! For though dark they stand,\n",
      "\n",
      "all woods there be must end at last,\n",
      "\n",
      "and see the open sun go past:\n",
      "\n",
      "the setting sun, the rising sun\n",
      "\n",
      "the day’s end, or the day begun\n",
      "\n",
      "For east or west all woods must fail\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fail – even as he said the word his voice faded into silence\n",
      "\n",
      "The air seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome\n",
      "\n",
      "Just behind them a large branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash into the path\n",
      "\n",
      "The trees seemed to close in before them\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They do not like all that about ending and failing,’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I should not sing any more at present\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait till we do get to the edge, and then we’ll turn and give them a rousing chorus!’He spoke cheerfully, and if he felt any great anxiety, he did not show it\n",
      "\n",
      "The others did not answer\n",
      "\n",
      "They were depressed\n",
      "\n",
      "A heavy weight was settling steadily on Frodo’s heart, and he regretted now with every step forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees\n",
      "\n",
      "He was, indeed, just about to stop and propose going back (if that was still possible), when things took a new turn\n",
      "\n",
      "The path stopped climbing, and became for a while nearly level\n",
      "\n",
      "The dark trees drew aside, and ahead they could see the path going almost straight forward\n",
      "\n",
      "Before them, but some distance off, there stood a green hill-top, treeless, rising like a bald head out of the encircling wood\n",
      "\n",
      "The path seemed to be making directly for it\n",
      "\n",
      "They now hurried forward again, delighted with the thought of climbing out for a while above the roof of the Forest\n",
      "\n",
      "The path dipped, and then again began to climb upwards, leading them at last to the foot of the steep hillside\n",
      "\n",
      "There it left the trees and faded into the turf\n",
      "\n",
      "The wood stood all round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits led their ponies up, winding round and round until they reached the top\n",
      "\n",
      "There they stood and gazed about them\n",
      "\n",
      "The air was gleaming and sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to any great distance\n",
      "\n",
      "Near at hand the mist was now almost gone; though here and there it lay in hollows of the wood, and to the south of them, out of a deep fold cutting right across the Forest, the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That,’ said Merry, pointing with his hand, ‘that is the line of the Withywindle\n",
      "\n",
      "It comes down out of the Downs and flows south-west through the midst of the Forest to join the Brandywine below Haysend\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t want to go that way! The Withywindle valley is said to be the queerest part of the whole wood – the centre from which all the queerness comes, as it were\n",
      "\n",
      "’The others looked in the direction that Merry pointed out, but they could see little but mists over the damp and deep-cut valley; and beyond it the southern half of the Forest faded from view\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun on the hill-top was now getting hot\n",
      "\n",
      "It must have been about eleven o’clock; but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in other directions\n",
      "\n",
      "In the west they could not make out either the line of the Hedge or the valley of the Brandywine beyond it\n",
      "\n",
      "Northward, where they looked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be the line of the great East Road, for which they were making\n",
      "\n",
      "They were on an island in a sea of trees, and the horizon was veiled\n",
      "\n",
      "On the south-eastern side the ground fell very steeply, as if the slopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees, like island-shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep waters\n",
      "\n",
      "They sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them, while they ate their mid-day meal\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far off in the east the grey-green lines of the Downs that lay beyond the Old Forest on that side\n",
      "\n",
      "That cheered them greatly; for it was good to see a sight of anything beyond the wood’s borders, though they did not mean to go that way, if they could help it: the Barrow-downs had as sinister a reputation in hobbit-legend as the Forest itself\n",
      "\n",
      "At length they made up their minds to go on again\n",
      "\n",
      "The path that had brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side; but they had not followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the right\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must actually be heading towards the Withywindle valley: not at all the direction they wished to take\n",
      "\n",
      "After some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path and strike northward; for although they had not been able to see it from the hill-top, the Road must lie that way, and it could not be many miles off\n",
      "\n",
      "Also northward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed to be drier and more open, climbing up to slopes where the trees were thinner, and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange and nameless trees of the denser wood\n",
      "\n",
      "At first their choice seemed to be good: they got along at a fair speed, though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards\n",
      "\n",
      "But after a time the trees began to close in again, just where they had appeared from a distance to be thinner and less tangled\n",
      "\n",
      "Then deep folds in the ground were discovered unexpectedly, like the ruts of great giant-wheels or wide moats and sunken roads long disused and choked with brambles\n",
      "\n",
      "These lay usually right across their line of march, and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out again, which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies\n",
      "\n",
      "Each time they climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and matted undergrowth, which somehow would not yield to the left, but only gave way when they turned to the right; and they had to go some distance along the bottom before they could find a way up the further bank\n",
      "\n",
      "Each time they clambered out, the trees seemed deeper and darker; and always to the left and upwards it was most difficult to find a way, and they were forced to the right and downwards\n",
      "\n",
      "After an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction, though they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all\n",
      "\n",
      "They were being headed off, and were simply following a course chosen for them – eastwards and southwards, into the heart of the Forest and not out of it\n",
      "\n",
      "The afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so steep and overhung that it proved impossible to climb out of it again, either forwards or backwards, without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind\n",
      "\n",
      "All they could do was to follow the fold – downwards\n",
      "\n",
      "The ground grew soft, and in places boggy; springs appeared in the banks, and soon they found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong and noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill\n",
      "\n",
      "They were in a deep dim-lit gully over-arched by trees high above them\n",
      "\n",
      "After stumbling along for some way along the stream, they came quite suddenly out of the gloom\n",
      "\n",
      "As if through a gate they saw the sunlight before them\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down through a cleft in a high steep bank, almost a cliff\n",
      "\n",
      "At its feet was a wide space of grass and reeds; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep\n",
      "\n",
      "A golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land between\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of it there wound lazily a dark river of brown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over with willows, blocked with fallen willows, and flecked with thousands of faded willow-leaves\n",
      "\n",
      "The air was thick with them, fluttering yellow from the branches; for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were creaking\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, now I have at least some notion of where we are!’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the River Withywindle! I will go on and explore\n",
      "\n",
      "’He passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while he reappeared, and reported that there was fairly solid ground between the cliff-foot and the river; in some places firm turf went down to the water’s edge\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What’s more,’ he said, ‘there seems to be something like a footpath winding along on this side of the river\n",
      "\n",
      "If we turn left and follow it, we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the Forest eventually\n",
      "\n",
      "I dare say!’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is, if the track goes on so far, and does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there\n",
      "\n",
      "Who made the track, do you suppose, and why? I am sure it was not for our benefit\n",
      "\n",
      "I am getting very suspicious of this Forest and everything in it, and I begin to believe all the stories about it\n",
      "\n",
      "And have you any idea how far eastward we should have to go?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No,’ said Merry, ‘I haven’t\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know in the least how far down the Withywindle we are, or who could possibly come here often enough to make a path along it\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is no other way out that I can see or think of\n",
      "\n",
      "’There being nothing else for it, they filed out, and Merry led them to the path that he had discovered\n",
      "\n",
      "Everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush and tall, in places far above their heads; but once found, the path was easy to follow, as it turned and twisted, picking out the sounder ground among the bogs and pools\n",
      "\n",
      "Here and there it passed over other rills, running down gullies into the Withywindle out of the higher forest-lands, and at these points there were tree-trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits began to feel very hot\n",
      "\n",
      "There were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round their ears, and the afternoon sun was burning on their backs\n",
      "\n",
      "At last they came suddenly into a thin shade; great grey branches reached across the path\n",
      "\n",
      "Each step forward became more reluctant than the last\n",
      "\n",
      "Sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs, and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod\n",
      "\n",
      "Just in front of him Pippin fell forward on to his knees\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo halted\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s no good,’ he heard Merry saying\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Can’t go another step without rest\n",
      "\n",
      "Must have nap\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s cool under the willows\n",
      "\n",
      "Less flies!’Frodo did not like the sound of this\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come on!’ he cried\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We can’t have a nap yet\n",
      "\n",
      "We must get clear of the Forest first\n",
      "\n",
      "’ But the others were too far gone to care\n",
      "\n",
      "Beside them Sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him\n",
      "\n",
      "His head swam\n",
      "\n",
      "There now seemed hardly a sound in the air\n",
      "\n",
      "The flies had stopped buzzing\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing, a soft fluttering as of a song half whispered, seemed to stir in the boughs above\n",
      "\n",
      "He lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning over him a huge willow-tree, old and hoary\n",
      "\n",
      "Enormous it looked, its sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many long-fingered hands, its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs moved\n",
      "\n",
      "The leaves fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him, and he toppled over, lying where he fell upon the grass\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry and Pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with their backs to the willow-trunk\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind them the great cracks gaped wide to receive them as the tree swayed and creaked\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked up at the grey and yellow leaves, moving softly against the light, and singing\n",
      "\n",
      "They shut their eyes, and then it seemed that they could almost hear words, cool words, saying something about water and sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "They gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpowering him; then with an effort he struggled to his feet again\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt a compelling desire for cool water\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Wait for me, Sam,’ he stammered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Must bathe feet a minute\n",
      "\n",
      "’Half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree, where great winding roots grew out into the stream, like gnarled dragonets straining down to drink\n",
      "\n",
      "He straddled one of these, and paddled his hot feet in the cool brown water; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back against the tree\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam sat down and scratched his head, and yawned like a cavern\n",
      "\n",
      "He was worried\n",
      "\n",
      "The afternoon was getting late, and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s more behind this than sun and warm air,’ he muttered to himself\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t like this great big tree\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t trust it\n",
      "\n",
      "Hark at it singing about sleep now! This won’t do at all!’He pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had become of the ponies\n",
      "\n",
      "He found that two had wandered on a good way along the path; and he had just caught them and brought them back towards the others, when he heard two noises; one loud, and the other soft but very clear\n",
      "\n",
      "One was the splash of something heavy falling into the water; the other was a noise like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast\n",
      "\n",
      "He rushed back to the bank\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo was in the water close to the edge, and a great tree-root seemed to be over him and holding him down, but he was not struggling\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam gripped him by the jacket, and dragged him from under the root; and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost at once he woke, and coughed and spluttered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you know, Sam,’ he said at length, ‘the beastly tree threw me in! I felt it\n",
      "\n",
      "The big root just twisted round and tipped me in!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You were dreaming I expect, Mr# Frodo,’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You shouldn’t sit in such a place, if you feel sleepy\n",
      "\n",
      "What about the others?’ Frodo asked\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wonder what sort of dreams they are having\n",
      "\n",
      "’They went round to the other side of the tree, and then Sam understood the click that he had heard\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin had vanished\n",
      "\n",
      "The crack by which he had laid himself had closed together, so that not a chink could be seen\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry was trapped: another crack had closed about his waist; his legs lay outside, but the rest of him was inside a dark opening, the edges of which gripped like a pair of pincers\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo and Sam beat first upon the tree-trunk where Pippin had lain\n",
      "\n",
      "They then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held poor Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "It was quite useless\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What a foul thing to happen!’ cried Frodo wildly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why did we ever come into this dreadful Forest? I wish we were all back at Crickhollow!’ He kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless of his own feet\n",
      "\n",
      "A hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches; the leaves rustled and whispered, but with a sound now of faint and far-off laughter\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I suppose we haven’t got an axe among our luggage, Mr# Frodo?’ asked Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That wouldn’t be much use\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait a minute!’ cried Sam, struck by an idea suggested by firewood\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We might do something with fire!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We might,’ said Frodo doubtfully\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We might succeed in roasting Pippin alive inside\n",
      "\n",
      "We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with,’ said Sam fiercely\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If it don’t let them go, I’ll have it down, if I have to gnaw it\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He ran to the ponies and before long came back with two tinder-boxes and a hatchet\n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits of bark; and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks\n",
      "\n",
      "These they heaped against the trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Sam had struck a spark into the tinder, it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of flame and smoke went up\n",
      "\n",
      "The twigs crackled\n",
      "\n",
      "Little fingers of fire licked against the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scorched it\n",
      "\n",
      "A tremor ran through the whole willow\n",
      "\n",

      "He fell silent again; but Frodo could not help asking one more question: the one he most desired to have answered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tell us, Master,’ he said, ‘about the Willow-man\n",
      "\n",
      "What is he? I have never heard of him before\n",
      "\n",
      "No, don’t!’ said Merry and Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not now! Not until the morning!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is right!’ said the old man\n",

      "Some things are ill to hear when the world’s in shadow\n",
      "\n",
      "Sleep till the morning-light, rest on the pillow! Heed no nightly noise! Fear no grey willow!’ And with that he took down the lamp and blew it out, and grasping a candle in either hand he led them out of the room\n",
      "\n",
      "Their mattresses and pillows were soft as down, and the blankets were of white wool\n",
      "\n",
      "They had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dead night, Frodo lay in a dream without light\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he saw the young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall of rock, pierced by a dark arch like a great gate\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to Frodo that he was lifted up, and passing over he saw that the rock-wall was a circle of hills, and that within it was a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone, like a vast tower but not made by hands\n",
      "\n",
      "On its top stood the figure of a man\n",
      "\n",
      "The moon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it\n",
      "\n",
      "Up from the dark plain below came the crying of fell voices, and the howling of many wolves\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed across the moon\n",
      "\n",
      "The figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he wielded\n",
      "\n",
      "A mighty eagle swept down and bore him away\n",
      "\n",
      "The voices wailed and the wolves yammered\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it was borne the sound of hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the East\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Black Riders!’ thought Frodo as he wakened, with the sound of the hoofs still echoing in his mind\n",
      "\n",
      "He wondered if he would ever again have the courage to leave the safety of these stone walls\n",
      "\n",
      "He lay motionless, still listening; but all was now silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep again or wandered into some other unremembered dream\n",
      "\n",
      "At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came over his dreams and he turned and groaned\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he woke, or thought he had waked, and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream: tip-tap, squeak: the noise was like branches fretting in the wind, twig-fingers scraping wall and window: creak, creak, creak\n",
      "\n",
      "He wondered if there were willow-trees close to the house; and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all, but inside the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat up, and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands, and he lay down again relieved\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears: ‘Fear nothing! Have peace until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!’ Then he went to sleep again\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the sound of water that Merry heard falling into his quiet sleep: water streaming down gently, and then spreading, spreading irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool\n",
      "\n",
      "It gurgled under the walls, and was rising slowly but surely\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I shall be drowned!’ he thought\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It will find its way in, and then I shall drown\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He felt that he was lying in a soft slimy bog, and springing up he set his foot on the corner of a cold hard flagstone\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he remembered where he was and lay down again\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed to hear or remember hearing: ‘Nothing passes doors or windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill-top\n",
      "\n",
      "’ A little breath of sweet air moved the curtain\n",
      "\n",
      "He breathed deep and fell asleep again\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as he could remember, Sam slept through the night in deep content, if logs are contented\n",
      "\n",
      "They woke up, all four at once, in the morning light\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom was moving about the room whistling like a starling\n",
      "\n",
      "When he heard them stir he clapped his hands, and cried: ‘Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My hearties!’ He drew back the yellow curtains, and the hobbits saw that these had covered the windows, at either end of the room, one looking east and the other looking west\n",
      "\n",
      "They leapt up refreshed\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo ran to the eastern window, and found himself looking into a kitchen-garden grey with dew\n",
      "\n",
      "He had half expected to see turf right up to the walls, turf all pocked with hoof-prints\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles; but above and far beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a pale morning: in the East, behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the edges, lay glimmering deeps of yellow\n",
      "\n",
      "The sky spoke of rain to come; but the light was broadening quickly, and the red flowers on the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin looked out of the western window, down into a pool of mist\n",
      "\n",
      "The Forest was hidden under a fog\n",
      "\n",
      "It was like looking down on to a sloping cloud-roof from above\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a fold or channel where the mist was broken into many plumes and billows: the valley of the Withywindle\n",
      "\n",
      "The stream ran down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows\n",
      "\n",
      "Near at hand was a flower-garden and a clipped hedge silver-netted, and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew-drops\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no willow-tree to be seen\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Good morning, merry friends!’ cried Tom, opening the eastern window wide\n",
      "\n",
      "A cool air flowed in; it had a rainy smell\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sun won’t show her face much today, I’m thinking\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been walking wide, leaping on the hill-tops, since the grey dawn began, nosing wind and weather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky above me\n",
      "\n",
      "I wakened Goldberry singing under window; but naught wakes hobbit-folk in the early morning\n",
      "\n",
      "In the night little folk wake up in the darkness, and sleep after light has come! Ring a ding dillo! Wake now, my merry friends! Forget the nightly noises! Ring a ding dillo del! derry del, my hearties! If you come soon you’ll find breakfast on the table\n",
      "\n",
      "If you come late you’ll get grass and rain-water!’Needless to say – not that Tom’s threat sounded very serious – the hobbits came soon, and left the table late and only when it was beginning to look rather empty\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither Tom nor Goldberry were there\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom could be heard about the house, clattering in the kitchen, and up and down the stairs, and singing here and there outside\n",
      "\n",
      "The room looked westward over the mist-clouded valley, and the window was open\n",
      "\n",
      "Water dripped down from the thatched eaves above\n",
      "\n",
      "Before they had finished breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbroken roof, and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind its deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled\n",
      "\n",
      "As they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was flowing down the rain out of the sky, the clear voice of Goldberry singing up above them\n",
      "\n",
      "They could hear few words, but it seemed plain to them that the song was a rain-song, as sweet as showers on dry hills, that told the tale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the Sea far below\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits listened with delight; and Frodo was glad in his heart, and blessed the kindly weather, because it delayed them from departing\n",
      "\n",
      "The thought of going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke; but he guessed now that they would not go further that day\n",
      "\n",
      "The upper wind settled in the West and deeper and wetter clouds rolled up to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the Downs\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could be seen all round the house but falling water\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo stood near the open door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and go bubbling away down into the valley\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom Bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house, waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain – and indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his boots\n",
      "\n",
      "These he took off and put in the chimney-corner\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he sat in the largest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is Goldberry’s washing day,’ he said, ‘and her autumn-cleaning\n",
      "\n",
      "Too wet for hobbit-folk – let them rest while they are able! It’s a good day for long tales, for questions and for answers, so Tom will start the talking\n",
      "\n",
      "’He then told them many remarkable stories, sometimes half as if speaking to himself, sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue eye under his deep brows\n",
      "\n",
      "Often his voice would turn to song, and he would get out of his chair and dance about\n",
      "\n",
      "He told them tales of bees and flowers, the ways of trees, and the strange creatures of the Forest, about the evil things and good things, things friendly and things unfriendly, cruel things and kind things, and secrets hidden under brambles\n",
      "\n",
      "As they listened, they began to understand the lives of the Forest, apart from themselves, indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all other things were at home\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving constantly in and out of his talk was Old Man Willow, and Frodo learned now enough to content him, indeed more than enough, for it was not comfortable lore\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom’s words laid bare the hearts of trees and their thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with a hatred of things that go free upon the earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not called the Old Forest without reason, for it was indeed ancient, a survivor of vast forgotten woods; and in it there lived yet, ageing no quicker than the hills, the fathers of the fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords\n",
      "\n",
      "The countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom, and with malice\n",
      "\n",
      "But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow: his heart was rotten, but his strength was green; and he was cunning, and a master of winds, and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the river\n",
      "\n",
      "His grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like fine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest from the Hedge to the Downs\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Tom’s talk left the woods and went leaping up the young stream, over bubbling waterfalls, over pebbles and worn rocks, and among small flowers in close grass and wet crannies, wandering at last up on to the Downs\n",
      "\n",
      "They heard of the Great Barrows, and the green mounds, and the stone-rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills\n",
      "\n",
      "Sheep were bleating in flocks\n",
      "\n",
      "Green walls and white walls rose\n",
      "\n",
      "There were fortresses on the heights\n",
      "\n",
      "Kings of little kingdoms fought together, and the young Sun shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords\n",
      "\n",
      "There was victory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went up into the sky\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens; and mounds covered them, and the stone doors were shut; and the grass grew over all\n",
      "\n",
      "Sheep walked for a while biting the grass, but soon the hills were empty again\n",
      "\n",
      "A shadow came out of dark places far away, and the bones were stirred in the mounds\n",
      "\n",
      "Barrow-wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers, and gold chains in the wind\n",
      "\n",
      "Stone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits shuddered\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in the Shire the rumour of the Barrow-wights of the Barrow-downs beyond the Forest had been heard\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to, even by a comfortable fireside far away\n",
      "\n",
      "These four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this house had driven from their minds: the house of Tom Bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of those dreaded hills\n",
      "\n",
      "They lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily, looking aside at one another\n",
      "\n",
      "When they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought, into times when the world was wider, and the seas flowed straight to the western Shore; and still on and back Tom went singing out into ancient starlight, when only the Elf-sires were awake\n",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly he stopped, and they saw that he nodded as if he was falling asleep\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits sat still before him, enchanted; and it seemed as if, under the spell of his words, the wind had gone, and the clouds had dried up, and the day had been withdrawn, and darkness had come from East and West, and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed Frodo could not tell\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not feel either hungry or tired, only filled with wonder\n",
      "\n",
      "The stars shone through the window and the silence of the heavens seemed to be round him\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke at last out of his wonder and a sudden fear of that silence:‘Who are you, Master?’ he asked\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Eh, what?’ said Tom sitting up, and his eyes glinting in the gloom\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t you know my name yet? That’s the only answer\n",
      "\n",
      "Tell me, who are you, alone, yourself and nameless? But you are young and I am old\n",
      "\n",
      "Eldest, that’s what I am\n",
      "\n",
      "Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before the river and the trees; Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn\n",
      "\n",
      "He made paths before the Big People, and saw the little People arriving\n",
      "\n",
      "He was here before the Kings and the graves and the Barrow-wights\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Elves passed westward, Tom was here already, before the seas were bent\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless – before the Dark Lord came from Outside\n",
      "\n",
      "’A shadow seemed to pass by the window, and the hobbits glanced hastily through the panes\n",
      "\n",
      "When they turned again, Goldberry stood in the door behind, framed in light\n",
      "\n",
      "She held a candle, shielding its flame from the draught with her hand; and the light flowed through it, like sunlight through a white shell\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The rain has ended,’ she said; ‘and new waters are running downhill, under the stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now laugh and be glad!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And let us have food and drink!’ cried Tom\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Long tales are thirsty\n",
      "\n",
      "And long listening’s hungry work, morning, noon, and evening!’ With that he jumped out of his chair, and with a bound took a candle from the chimney-shelf and lit it in the flame that Goldberry held; then he danced about the table\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared\n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly he returned, bearing a large and laden tray\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Tom and Goldberry set the table; and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in laughter: so fair was the grace of Goldberry and so merry and odd the caperings of Tom\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance, neither hindering the other, in and out of the room, and round about the table; and with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in order\n",
      "\n",
      "The boards blazed with candles, white and yellow\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom bowed to his guests\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Supper is ready,’ said Goldberry; and now the hobbits saw that she was clothed all in silver with a white girdle, and her shoes were like fishes’ mail\n",
      "\n",
      "But Tom was all in clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, and he had green stockings\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a supper even better than before\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits under the spell of Tom’s words may have missed one meal or many, but when the food was before them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not sing or even speak much for a while, and paid close attention to business\n",
      "\n",
      "But after a time their hearts and spirits rose high again, and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter\n",
      "\n",
      "After they had eaten, Goldberry sang many songs for them, songs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence; and in the silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had known, and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like jewels in the depths\n",
      "\n",
      "Then once more she wished them each good night and left them by the fireside\n",
      "\n",
      "But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them with questions\n",
      "\n",
      "He appeared already to know much about them and all their families, and indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the Shire down from days hardly remembered among the hobbits themselves\n",
      "\n",
      "It no longer surprised them; but he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance than they had imagined\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s earth under his old feet, and clay on his fingers; wisdom in his bones, and both his eyes are open,’ said Tom\n",
      "\n",
      "It was also clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed that in some fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had told before even to Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom wagged his head up and down, and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Show me the precious Ring!’ he said suddenly in the midst of the story: and Frodo, to his own astonishment, drew out the chain from his pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big brown-skinned hand\n",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed\n",
      "\n",
      "For a second the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming, of his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Tom put the Ring round the end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they gasped\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no sign of Tom disappearing!Tom laughed again, and then he spun the Ring in the air – and it vanished with a flash\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo gave a cry – and Tom leaned forward and handed it back to him with a smile\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like one who has lent a trinket to a juggler)\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the same Ring, or looked the same and weighed the same: for that Ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand\n",
      "\n",
      "But something prompted him to make sure\n",
      "\n",
      "He was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so perilously important\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and checked an exclamation\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo was delighted (in a way): it was his own ring all right, for Merry was staring blankly at his chair, and obviously could not see him\n",

      "Tom now told them that he reckoned the Sun would shine tomorrow, and it would be a glad morning, and setting out would be hopeful\n",
      "\n",
      "But they would do well to start early; for weather in that country was a thing that even Tom could not be sure of for long, and it would change sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket\n",

      "\n",
      "Don’t you go a-meddling with old stone or cold Wights or prying in their houses, unless you be strong folk with hearts that never falter!’ He said this more than once; and he advised them to pass barrows by on the west-side, if they chanced to stray near one\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he taught them a rhyme to sing, if they should by ill-luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next day\n",

      "But either in his dreams or out of them, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind: a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver, until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise\n",
      "\n",
      "The vision melted into waking; and there was Tom whistling like a tree-full of birds; and the sun was already slanting down the hill and through the open window\n",

      "\n",
      "‘My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We have never said farewell to her, nor seen her since the evening!’ He was so distressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clear call came rippling down\n",

      "There on the hill-brow she stood beckoning to them: her hair was flying loose, and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered\n",
      "\n",
      "A light like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she danced\n",
      "\n",
      "They hastened up the last slope, and stood breathless beside her\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "They took a deep draught of the air, and felt that a skip and a few stout strides would bear them wherever they wished\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the Road, when they should be leaping, as lusty as Tom, over the stepping stones of the hills straight towards the Mountains\n",

      "\n",
      "As they looked she gave a clear call, and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill\n",
      "\n",
      "Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, and then over the shoulders of further hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth sides again, up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no tree nor any visible water: it was a country of grass and short springy turf, silent except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land, and high lonely cries of strange birds\n",

      "About mid-day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened, like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside there was no air stirring, and the sky seemed near their heads\n",
      "\n",
      "They rode across and looked northwards\n",

      "Certainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptive, but there could be no doubt that the Downs were coming to an end\n",
      "\n",
      "A long valley lay below them winding away northwards, until it came to an opening between two steep shoulders\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond, there seemed to be no more hills\n",
      "\n",
      "Due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is a line of trees,’ said Merry, ‘and that must mark the Road\n",

      "All along it for many leagues east of the Bridge there are trees growing\n",
      "\n",
      "Some say they were planted in the old days\n",

      "Splendid!’ said Frodo\n",

      "‘If we make as good going this afternoon as we have done this morning, we shall have left the Downs before the Sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place\n",
      "\n",
      "’ But even as he spoke he turned his glance eastwards, and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and looked down upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green mounds, and on some were standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums\n",
      "\n",
      "That view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sight and went down into the hollow circle\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of it there stood a single stone, standing tall under the sun above, and at this hour casting no shadow\n",
      "\n",
      "It was shapeless and yet significant: like a landmark, or a guarding finger, or more like a warning\n",
      "\n",
      "But they were now hungry, and the sun was still at the fearless noon; so they set their backs against the east side of the stone\n",
      "\n",
      "It was cool, as if the sun had had no power to warm it; but at that time this seemed pleasant\n",
      "\n",
      "There they took food and drink, and made as good a noon-meal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for the food came from ‘down under Hill’\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of the day\n",
      "\n",
      "Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass\n",
      "\n",
      "Riding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and the scent of turf, lying a little too long, stretching out their legs and looking at the sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps, enough to explain what happened\n",
      "\n",
      "However that may be: they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take\n",
      "\n",
      "The standing stone was cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming through the mist just above the west wall of the hollow in which they lay; north, south, and east, beyond the wall the fog was thick, cold and white\n",
      "\n",
      "The air was silent, heavy and chill\n",
      "\n",
      "Their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads down\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm, and ran to the western rim\n",
      "\n",
      "They found that they were upon an island in the fog\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as they looked out in dismay towards the setting sun, it sank before their eyes into a white sea, and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the East behind\n",
      "\n",
      "The fog rolled up to the walls and rose above them, and as it mounted it bent over their heads until it became a roof: they were shut in a hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing stone\n",
      "\n",
      "They felt as if a trap was closing about them; but they did not quite lose heart\n",
      "\n",
      "They still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of the Road ahead, and they still knew in which direction it lay\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone that no thought of remaining there was in their minds\n",
      "\n",
      "They packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and down the long northward slope of the hill, down into a foggy sea\n",
      "\n",
      "As they went down the mist became colder and damper, and their hair hung lank and dripping on their foreheads\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the bottom it was so chill that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods, which soon became bedewed with grey drops\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, mounting their ponies, they went slowly on again, feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground\n",
      "\n",
      "They were steering, as well as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far northward end of the long valley which they had seen in the morning\n",
      "\n",
      "Once they were through the gap, they had only to keep on in anything like a straight line and they were bound in the end to strike the Road\n",
      "\n",
      "Their thoughts did not go beyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the Downs there might be no fog\n",
      "\n",
      "Their going was very slow\n",
      "\n",
      "To prevent their getting separated and wandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam was behind him, and after him came Pippin, and then Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "The valley seemed to stretch on endlessly\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign\n",
      "\n",
      "On either side ahead a darkness began to loom through the mist; and he guessed that they were at last approaching the gap in the hills, the north-gate of the Barrow-downs\n",
      "\n",
      "If they could pass that, they would be free\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come on! Follow me!’ he called back over his shoulder, and he hurried forward\n",
      "\n",
      "But his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm\n",
      "\n",
      "The dark patches grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenly he saw, towering ominous before him and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a headless door, two huge standing stones\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not remember having seen any sign of these in the valley, when he looked out from the hill in the morning\n",
      "\n",
      "He had passed between them almost before he was aware: and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round him\n",
      "\n",
      "His pony reared and snorted, and he fell off\n",
      "\n",
      "When he looked back he found that he was alone: the others had not followed him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sam!’ he called\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why don’t you keep up?’There was no answer\n",
      "\n",
      "Fear took him, and he ran back past the stones shouting wildly: ‘Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!’ The pony bolted into the mist and vanished\n",
      "\n",
      "From some way off, or so it seemed, he thought he heard a cry: ‘Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!’ It was away eastward, on his left as he stood under the great stones, staring and straining into the gloom\n",
      "\n",
      "He plunged off in the direction of the call, and found himself going steeply uphill\n",
      "\n",
      "As he struggled on he called again, and kept on calling more and more frantically; but he heard no answer for some time, and then it seemed faint and far ahead and high above him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Frodo! Hoy!’ came the thin voices out of the mist: and then a cry that sounded like help, help! often repeated, ending with a last help! that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut short\n",
      "\n",
      "He stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries; but the light was now gone, and clinging night had closed about him, so that it was impossible to be sure of any direction\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed all the time to be climbing up and up\n",
      "\n",
      "Only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he at last came to the top of a ridge or hill\n",
      "\n",
      "He was weary, sweating and yet chilled\n",
      "\n",
      "It was wholly dark\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where are you?’ he cried out miserably\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no reply\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood listening\n",
      "\n",
      "He was suddenly aware that it was getting very cold, and that up here a wind was beginning to blow, an icy wind\n",
      "\n",
      "A change was coming in the weather\n",
      "\n",
      "The mist was flowing past him now in shreds and tatters\n",
      "\n",
      "His breath was smoking, and the darkness was less near and thick\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind began to hiss over the grass\n",
      "\n",
      "He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and he made towards it; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside, and the starry sky was unveiled\n",
      "\n",
      "A glance showed him that he was now facing southwards and was on a round hill-top, which he must have climbed from the north\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the east the biting wind was blowing\n",
      "\n",
      "To his right there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape\n",
      "\n",
      "A great barrow stood there\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where are you?’ he cried again, both angry and afraid\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Here!’ said a voice, deep and cold, that seemed to come out of the ground\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am waiting for you!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No!’ said Frodo; but he did not run away\n",
      "\n",
      "His knees gave, and he fell on the ground\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing happened, and there was no sound\n",
      "\n",
      "Trembling he looked up, in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars\n",
      "\n",
      "It leaned over him\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought there were two eyes, very cold though lit with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a grip stronger and colder than iron seized him\n",
      "\n",
      "The icy touch froze his bones, and he remembered no more\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall nothing except a sense of dread\n",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow\n",
      "\n",
      "A Barrow-wight had taken him, and he was probably already under the dreadful spells of the Barrow-wights about which whispered tales spoke\n",
      "\n",
      "He dared not move, but lay as he found himself: flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast\n",
      "\n",
      "But though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very darkness that was round him, he found himself as he lay thinking about Bilbo Baggins and his stories, of their jogging along together in the lanes of the Shire and talking about roads and adventures\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a seed of courage hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid hobbit, waiting for some final and desperate danger to make it grow\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though he did not know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf ) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought he had come to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought hardened him\n",
      "\n",
      "He found himself stiffening, as if for a final spring; he no longer felt limp like a helpless prey\n",
      "\n",
      "As he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed all at once that the darkness was slowly giving way: a pale greenish light was growing round him\n",
      "\n",
      "It did not at first show him what kind of a place he was in, for the light seemed to be coming out of himself, and from the floor beside him, and had not yet reached the roof or wall\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned, and there in the cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, and Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "They were on their backs, and their faces looked deathly pale; and they were clad in white\n",
      "\n",
      "About them lay many treasures, of gold maybe, though in that light they looked cold and unlovely\n",
      "\n",
      "On their heads were circlets, gold chains were about their waists, and on their fingers were many rings\n",
      "\n",
      "Swords lay by their sides, and shields were at their feet\n",
      "\n",
      "But across their three necks lay one long naked sword\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising and falling\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary, sometimes high in the air and thin, sometimes like a low moan from the ground\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds, strings of words would now and again shape themselves: grim, hard, cold words, heartless and miserable\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was railing against the morning of which it was bereaved, and the cold was cursing the warmth for which it hungered\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo was chilled to the marrow\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while the song became clearer, and with dread in his heart he perceived that it had changed into an incantation:Cold be hand and heart and bone,\n",
      "\n",
      "and cold be sleep under stone:\n",
      "\n",
      "never more to wake on stony bed,\n",

      "till the dark lord lifts his hand\n",
      "\n",
      "over dead sea and withered land\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound\n",
      "\n",
      "Raising himself on one arm he looked, and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind of passage which behind them turned a corner\n",
      "\n",
      "Round the corner a long arm was groping, walking on its fingers towards Sam, who was lying nearest, and towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him\n",
      "\n",
      "At first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the incantation\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a wild thought of escape came to him\n",
      "\n",
      "He wondered if he put on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight would miss him, and he might find some way out\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought of himself running free over the grass, grieving for Merry, and Sam, and Pippin, but free and alive himself\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do\n",
      "\n",
      "But the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong: he could not leave his friends so easily\n",
      "\n",
      "He wavered, groping in his pocket, and then fought with himself again; and as he did so the arm crept nearer\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly resolve hardened in him, and he seized a short sword that lay beside him, and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions\n",
      "\n",
      "With what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist, and the hand broke off; but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a shriek and the light vanished\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dark there was a snarling noise\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo fell forward over Merry, and Merry’s face felt cold\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once back into his mind, from which it had disappeared with the first coming of the fog, came the memory of the house down under the Hill, and of Tom singing\n",
      "\n",
      "He remembered the rhyme that Tom had taught them\n",
      "\n",
      "In a small desperate voice he began: Ho! Tom Bombadil! and with that name his voice seemed to grow strong: it had a full and lively sound, and the dark chamber echoed as if to drum and trumpet\n",
      "\n",
      "Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!\n",
      "\n",
      "By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,\n",
      "\n",
      "By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!\n",
      "\n",
      "Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a sudden deep silence, in which Frodo could hear his heart beating\n",
      "\n",
      "After a long slow moment he heard plain, but far away, as if it was coming down through the ground or through thick walls, an answering voice singing:Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow,\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow\n",
      "\n",
      "None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master:\n",
      "\n",
      "His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a loud rumbling sound, as of stones rolling and falling, and suddenly light streamed in, real light, the plain light of day\n",
      "\n",
      "A low door-like opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond Frodo’s feet; and there was Tom’s head (hat, feather, and all) framed against the light of the sun rising red behind him\n",
      "\n",
      "The light fell upon the floor, and upon the faces of the three hobbits lying beside Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not stir, but the sickly hue had left them\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked now as if they were only very deeply asleep\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom stooped, removed his hat, and came into the dark chamber, singing:Get out, you old Wight! Vanish in the sunlight!\n",
      "\n",
      "Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing,\n",
      "\n",
      "Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains!\n",
      "\n",
      "Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty!\n",
      "\n",
      "Lost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness,\n",
      "\n",
      "Where gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended\n",
      "\n",
      "At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crash\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was a long trailing shriek, fading away into an unguessable distance; and after that silence\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come, friend Frodo!’ said Tom\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Let us get out on to clean grass! You must help me bear them\n",
      "\n",
      "’Together they carried out Merry, Pippin, and Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "As Frodo left the barrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still, like a wounded spider, in a heap of fallen earth\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom went back in again, and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping\n",
      "\n",
      "When he came out he was bearing in his arms a great load of treasure: things of gold, silver, copper, and bronze; many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments\n",
      "\n",
      "He climbed the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine\n",
      "\n",
      "There he stood, with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair, and looked down upon the three hobbits, that had been laid on their backs upon the grass at the west side of the mound\n",
      "\n",
      "Raising his right hand he said in a clear and commanding voice:Wake now my merry lads! Wake and hear me calling!\n",
      "\n",
      "Warm now be heart and limb! The cold stone is fallen;\n",
      "\n",
      "Dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken\n",
      "\n",
      "Night under Night is flown, and the Gate is open!\n",
      "\n",
      "To Frodo’s great joy the hobbits stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed their eyes, and then suddenly sprang up\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked about in amazement, first at Frodo, and then at Tom standing large as life on the barrow-top above them; and then at themselves in their thin white rags, crowned and belted with pale gold, and jingling with trinkets\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What in the name of wonder?’ began Merry, feeling the golden circlet that had slipped over one eye\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he stopped, and a shadow came over his face, and he closed his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course, I remember!’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The men of Carn Dûm came on us at night, and we were worsted\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah! the spear in my heart!’ He clutched at his breast\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No! No!’ he said, opening his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What am I saying? I have been dreaming\n",
      "\n",
      "Where did you get to, Frodo?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I thought that I was lost,’ said Frodo; ‘but I don’t want to speak of it\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us think of what we are to do now! Let us go on!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Dressed up like this, sir?’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where are my clothes?’ He flung his circlet, belt, and rings on the grass, and looked round helplessly, as if he expected to find his cloak, jacket, and breeches, and other hobbit-garments lying somewhere to hand\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You won’t find your clothes again,’ said Tom, bounding down from the mound, and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight\n",
      "\n",
      "One would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened; and indeed the horror faded out of their hearts as they looked at him, and saw the merry glint in his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you mean?’ asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled and half amused\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why not?’But Tom shook his head, saying: ‘You’ve found yourselves again, out of the deep water\n",
      "\n",
      "Clothes are but little loss, if you escape from drowning\n",
      "\n",
      "Be glad, my merry friends, and let the warm sunlight heat now heart and limb! Cast off these cold rags! Run naked on the grass, while Tom goes a-hunting!’He sprang away down hill, whistling and calling\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking down after him Frodo saw him running away southwards along the green hollow between their hill and the next, still whistling and crying:Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander?\n",
      "\n",
      "Up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin,\n",
      "\n",
      "White-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin!\n",
      "\n",
      "So he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat and catching it, until he was hidden by a fold of the ground: but for some time his hey now! hoy now! came floating back down the wind, which had shifted round towards the south\n",
      "\n",
      "The air was growing very warm again\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits ran about for a while on the grass, as he told them\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they lay basking in the sun with the delight of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a friendly clime, or of people that, after being long ill and bedridden, wake one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promise\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (and hungry)\n",
      "\n",
      "He reappeared, hat first, over the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an obedient line six ponies: their own five and one more\n",
      "\n",
      "The last was plainly old Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger, fatter (and older) than their own ponies\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry, to whom the others belonged, had not, in fact, given them any such names, but they answered to the new names that Tom had given them for the rest of their lives\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom called them one by one and they climbed over the brow and stood in a line\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Tom bowed to the hobbits\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Here are your ponies, now!’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They’ve more sense (in some ways) than you wandering hobbits have – more sense in their noses\n",
      "\n",
      "For they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into; and if they run to save themselves, then they run the right way\n",
      "\n",
      "You must forgive them all; for though their hearts are faithful, to face fear of Barrow-wights is not what they were made for\n",
      "\n",
      "See, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!’Merry, Sam, and Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from their packs; and they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged to put on some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the oncoming of winter\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where does that other old animal, that Fatty Lumpkin, come from?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He’s mine,’ said Tom\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride him, and he wanders often far, free upon the hillsides\n",
      "\n",
      "When your ponies stayed with me, they got to know my Lumpkin; and they smelt him in the night, and quickly ran to meet him\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought he’d look for them and with his words of wisdom take all their fear away\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old Tom’s going to ride\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey! he’s coming with you, just to set you on the road; so he needs a pony\n",
      "\n",
      "For you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding, when you’re on your own legs trying to trot beside them\n",
      "\n",
      "’The hobbits were delighted to hear this, and thanked Tom many times; but he laughed, and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he would not feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’ve got things to do,’ he said: ‘my making and my singing, my talking and my walking, and my watching of the country\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom can’t be always near to open doors and willow-cracks\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting\n",
      "\n",
      "’It was still fairly early by the sun, something between nine and ten, and the hobbits turned their minds to food\n",
      "\n",
      "Their last meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the day before\n",
      "\n",
      "They breakfasted now off the remainder of Tom’s provisions, meant for their supper, with additions that Tom had brought with him\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not a large meal (considering hobbits and the circumstances), but they felt much better for it\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were eating Tom went up to the mound, and looked through the treasures\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of these he made into a pile that glistered and sparkled on the grass\n",
      "\n",
      "He bade them lie there ‘free to all finders, birds, beasts, Elves or Men, and all kindly creatures’; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and no Wight ever come back to it\n",
      "\n",
      "He chose for himself from the pile a brooch set with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers or the wings of blue butterflies\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked long at it, as if stirred by some memory, shaking his head, and saying at last:‘Here is a pretty toy for Tom and for his lady! Fair was she who long ago wore this on her shoulder\n",
      "\n",
      "Goldberry shall wear it now, and we will not forget her!’For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold\n",
      "\n",
      "They gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought of some strange metal, light and strong, and set with many fiery stones\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound, the blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sharp blades are good to have, if Shire-folk go walking, east, south, or far away into dark and danger\n",
      "\n",
      "’ Then he told them that these blades were forged many long years ago by Men of Westernesse: they were foes of the Dark Lord, but they were overcome by the evil king of Carn Dûm in the Land of Angmar\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Few now remember them,’ Tom murmured, ‘yet still some go wandering, sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness, guarding from evil things folk that are heedless\n",
      "\n",
      "’The hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke they had a vision as it were of a great expanse of years behind them, like a vast shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of Men, tall and grim with bright swords, and last came one with a star on his brow\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the vision faded, and they were back in the sunlit world\n",
      "\n",
      "It was time to start again\n",
      "\n",
      "They made ready, packing their bags and lading their ponies\n",
      "\n",
      "Their new weapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets, feeling them very awkward, and wondering if they would be of any use\n",
      "\n",
      "Fighting had not before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their flight would land them\n",
      "\n",
      "At last they set off\n",
      "\n",
      "They led their ponies down the hill; and then mounting they trotted quickly along the valley\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked back and saw the top of the old mound on the hill, and from it the sunlight on the gold went up like a yellow flame\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they turned a shoulder of the Downs and it was hidden from view\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great stones standing like a gate, and before long they came to the northern gap and rode swiftly through, and the land fell away before them\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a merry journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, or before them, on Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom sang most of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight\n",
      "\n",
      "They went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the Road was further away than they had imagined\n",
      "\n",
      "Even without a fog, their sleep at mid-day would have prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day before\n",
      "\n",
      "The dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further side\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom said that it had once been the boundary of a kingdom, but a very long time ago\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed to remember something sad about it, and would not say much\n",
      "\n",
      "They climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall, and then Tom turned due north, for they had been bearing somewhat to the west\n",
      "\n",
      "The land was now open and fairly level, and they quickened their pace, but the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall trees ahead, and they knew that they had come back to the Road after many unexpected adventures\n",
      "\n",
      "They galloped their ponies over the last furlongs, and halted under the long shadows of the trees\n",
      "\n",
      "They were on the top of a sloping bank, and the Road, now dim as evening drew on, wound away below them\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point it ran nearly from South-west to North-east, and on their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow\n",
      "\n",
      "It was rutted and bore many signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools and pot-holes full of water\n",
      "\n",
      "They rode down the bank and looked up and down\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing to be seen\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, here we are again at last!’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I suppose we haven’t lost more than two days by my short cut through the Forest! But perhaps the delay will prove useful – it may have put them off our trail\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "The others looked at him\n",
      "\n",
      "The shadow of the fear of the Black Riders came suddenly over them again\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since they had entered the Forest they had thought chiefly of getting back to the Road; only now when it lay beneath their feet did they remember the danger which pursued them, and was more than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the Road itself\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked anxiously back towards the setting sun, but the Road was brown and empty\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you think,’ asked Pippin hesitatingly, ‘do you think we may be pursued, tonight?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, I hope not tonight,’ answered Tom Bombadil; ‘nor perhaps the next day\n",
      "\n",
      "But do not trust my guess; for I cannot tell for certain\n",
      "\n",
      "Out east my knowledge fails\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom is not master of Riders from the Black Land far beyond his country\n",
      "\n",
      "’All the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them\n",
      "\n",
      "They felt that he would know how to deal with Black Riders, if anyone did\n",
      "\n",
      "They would soon now be going forward into lands wholly strange to them, and beyond all but the most vague and distant legends of the Shire, and in the gathering twilight they longed for home\n",
      "\n",
      "A deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them\n",
      "\n",
      "They stood silent, reluctant to make the final parting, and only slowly became aware that Tom was wishing them farewell, and telling them to have good heart and to ride on till dark without halting\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tom will give you good advice, till this day is over (after that your own luck must go with you and guide you): four miles along the Road you’ll come upon a village, Bree under Bree-hill, with doors looking westward\n",
      "\n",
      "There you’ll find an old inn that is called The Prancing Pony\n",
      "\n",
      "Barliman Butterbur is the worthy keeper\n",
      "\n",
      "There you can stay the night, and afterwards the morning will speed you upon your way\n",
      "\n",
      "Be bold, but wary! Keep up your merry hearts, and ride to meet your fortune!’They begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more with them; but he laughed and refused, saying:Tom’s country ends here: he will not pass the borders\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped on Lumpkin’s back, and rode up over the bank and away singing into the dusk\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am sorry to take leave of Master Bombadil,’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He’s a caution and no mistake\n",
      "\n",
      "I reckon we may go a good deal further and see naught better, nor queerer\n",
      "\n",
      "But I won’t deny I’ll be glad to see this Prancing Pony he spoke of\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope it’ll be like The Green Dragon away back home! What sort of folk are they in Bree?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There are hobbits in Bree,’ said Merry, ‘as well as Big Folk\n",

      "Few had survived the turmoils of the Elder Days; but when the Kings returned again over the Great Sea they had found the Bree-men still there, and they were still there now, when the memory of the old Kings had faded into the grass\n",
      "\n",
      "In those days no other Men had settled dwellings so far west, or within a hundred leagues of the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the wild lands beyond Bree there were mysterious wanderers\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bree-folk called them Rangers, and knew nothing of their origin\n",
      "\n",
      "They were taller and darker than the Men of Bree and were believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing, and to understand the languages of beasts and birds\n",
      "\n",
      "They roamed at will southwards, and eastwards even as far as the Misty Mountains; but they were now few and rarely seen\n",
      "\n",
      "When they appeared they brought news from afar, and told strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to; but the Bree-folk did not make friends of them\n",
      "\n",
      "There were also many families of hobbits in the Bree-land; and they claimed to be the oldest settlement of Hobbits in the world, one that was founded long before even the Brandywine was crossed and the Shire colonized\n",
      "\n",
      "They lived mostly in Staddle though there were some in Bree itself, especially on the higher slopes of the hill, above the houses of the Men\n",
      "\n",
      "The Big Folk and the Little Folk (as they called one another) were on friendly terms, minding their own affairs in their own ways, but both rightly regarding themselves as necessary parts of the Bree-folk\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowhere else in the world was this peculiar (but excellent) arrangement to be found\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bree-folk, Big and Little, did not themselves travel much; and the affairs of the four villages were their chief concern\n",
      "\n",
      "Occasionally the Hobbits of Bree went as far as Buckland, or the Eastfarthing; but though their little land was not much further than a day’s riding east of the Brandywine Bridge, the Hobbits of the Shire now seldom visited it\n",
      "\n",
      "An occasional Bucklander or adventurous Took would come out to the Inn for a night or two, but even that was becoming less and less usual\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shire-hobbits referred to those of Bree, and to any others that lived beyond the borders, as Outsiders, and took very little interest in them, considering them dull and uncouth\n",
      "\n",
      "There were probably many more Outsiders scattered about in the West of the World in those days than the people of the Shire imagined\n",
      "\n",
      "Some, doubtless, were no better than tramps, ready to dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the Bree-land, at any rate, the hobbits were decent and prosperous, and no more rustic than most of their distant relatives Inside\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not yet forgotten that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between the Shire and Bree\n",
      "\n",
      "There was Bree-blood in the Brandybucks by all accounts\n",
      "\n",
      "The village of Bree had some hundred stone houses of the Big Folk, mostly above the Road, nestling on the hillside with windows looking west\n",
      "\n",
      "On that side, running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to it, there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side\n",
      "\n",
      "Over this the Road crossed by a causeway; but where it pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another gate in the southern corner where the Road ran out of the village\n",
      "\n",
      "The gates were closed at nightfall; but just inside them were small lodges for the gatekeepers\n",
      "\n",
      "Down on the Road, where it swept to the right to go round the foot of the hill, there was a large inn\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been built long ago when the traffic on the roads had been far greater\n",
      "\n",
      "For Bree stood at an old meeting of ways; another ancient road crossed the East Road just outside the dike at the western end of the village, and in former days Men and other folk of various sorts had travelled much on it\n",
      "\n",
      "Strange as News from Bree was still a saying in the Eastfarthing, descending from those days, when news from North, South, and East could be heard in the inn, and when the Shire-hobbits used to go more often to hear it\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Northern Lands had long been desolate, and the North Road was now seldom used: it was grass-grown, and the Bree-folk called it the Greenway\n",
      "\n",
      "The Inn of Bree was still there, however, and the innkeeper was an important person\n",
      "\n",
      "His house was a meeting place for the idle, talkative, and inquisitive among the inhabitants, large and small, of the four villages; and a resort of Rangers and other wanderers, and for such travellers (mostly dwarves) as still journeyed on the East Road, to and from the Mountains\n",
      "\n",
      "It was dark, and white stars were shining, when Frodo and his companions came at last to the Greenway-crossing and drew near the village\n",
      "\n",
      "They came to the West-gate and found it shut; but at the door of the lodge beyond it, there was a man sitting\n",
      "\n",
      "He jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked over the gate at them in surprise\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you want, and where do you come from?’ he asked gruffly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We are making for the inn here,’ answered Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We are journeying east and cannot go further tonight\n",
      "\n",
      "Hobbits! Four hobbits! And what’s more, out of the Shire by their talk,’ said the gatekeeper, softly as if speaking to himself\n",
      "\n",
      "He stared at them darkly for a moment, and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride through\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We don’t often see Shire-folk riding on the Road at night,’ he went on, as they halted a moment by his door\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You’ll pardon my wondering what business takes you away east of Bree! What may your names be, might I ask?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Our names and our business are our own, and this does not seem a good place to discuss them,’ said Frodo, not liking the look of the man or the tone of his voice\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Your business is your own, no doubt,’ said the man; ‘but it’s my business to ask questions after nightfall\n",
      "\n",
      "We are hobbits from Buckland, and we have a fancy to travel and to stay at the inn here,’ put in Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am Mr# Brandybuck\n",
      "\n",
      "Is that enough for you? The Bree-folk used to be fair-spoken to travellers, or so I had heard\n",
      "\n",
      "All right, all right!’ said the man\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I meant no offence\n",
      "\n",
      "But you’ll find maybe that more folk than old Harry at the gate will be asking you questions\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s queer folk about\n",
      "\n",
      "If you go on to The Pony, you’ll find you’re not the only guests\n",
      "\n",
      "’He wished them good night, and they said no more; but Frodo could see in the lantern-light that the man was still eyeing them curiously\n",
      "\n",
      "He was glad to hear the gate clang to behind them, as they rode forward\n",
      "\n",
      "He wondered why the man was so suspicious, and whether anyone had been asking for news of a party of hobbits\n",
      "\n",
      "Could it have been Gandalf? He might have arrived, while they were delayed in the Forest and the Downs\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was something in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy\n",
      "\n",
      "The man stared after the hobbits for a moment, and then he went back to his house\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as his back was turned, a dark figure climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village street\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits rode on up a gentle slope, passing a few detached houses, and drew up outside the inn\n",
      "\n",
      "The houses looked large and strange to them\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows, and felt his heart sink\n",
      "\n",
      "He had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees, and other creatures even more terrifying, some time or other in the course of his journey; but at the moment he was finding his first sight of Men and their tall houses quite enough, indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring day\n",
      "\n",
      "He pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the inn-yard, and Black Riders peering out of dark upper windows\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We surely aren’t going to stay here for the night, are we, sir?’ he exclaimed\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If there are hobbit-folk in these parts, why don’t we look for some that would be willing to take us in? It would be more homelike\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s wrong with the inn?’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tom Bombadil recommended it\n",
      "\n",
      "I expect it’s homelike enough inside\n",
      "\n",
      "’Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "It had a front on the Road, and two wings running back on land partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill, so that at the rear the second-floor windows were level with the ground\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a wide arch leading to a courtyard between the two wings, and on the left under the arch there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps\n",
      "\n",
      "The door was open and light streamed out of it\n",
      "\n",
      "Above the arch there was a lamp, and beneath it swung a large signboard: a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the door was painted in white letters: the prancing pony by barliman butterbur\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains\n",
      "\n",
      "As they hesitated outside in the gloom, someone began singing a merry song inside, and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus\n",
      "\n",
      "They listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their ponies\n",
      "\n",
      "The song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping\n",
      "\n",
      "They led their ponies under the arch, and leaving them standing in the yard they climbed up the steps\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a short fat man with a bald head and a red face\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a white apron on, and was bustling out of one door and in through another, carrying a tray laden with full mugs\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Can we——’ began Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Half a minute, if you please!’ shouted the man over his shoulder, and vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke\n",
      "\n",
      "In a moment he was out again, wiping his hands on his apron\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Good evening, little master!’ he said, bending down\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What may you be wanting?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Beds for four, and stabling for five ponies, if that can be managed\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you Mr# Butterbur?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s right! Barliman is my name\n",
      "\n",
      "Barliman Butterbur at your service! You’re from the Shire, eh?’ he said, and then suddenly he clapped his hand to his forehead, as if trying to remember something\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hobbits!’ he cried\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now what does that remind me of? Might I ask your names, sirs?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mr# Took and Mr# Brandybuck,’ said Frodo; ‘and this is Sam Gamgee\n",
      "\n",
      "My name is Underhill\n",
      "\n",
      "There now!’ said Mr# Butterbur, snapping his fingers\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s gone again! But it’ll come back, when I have time to think\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m run off my feet; but I’ll see what I can do for you\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t often get a party out of the Shire nowadays, and I should be sorry not to make you welcome\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is such a crowd already in the house tonight as there hasn’t been for long enough\n",
      "\n",
      "It never rains but it pours, we say in Bree\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi! Nob!’ he shouted\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where are you, you woolly-footed slowcoach? Nob!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Coming, sir! Coming!’ A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out of a door, and seeing the travellers, stopped short and stared at them with great interest\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where’s Bob?’ asked the landlord\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You don’t know? Well, find him! Double sharp! I haven’t got six legs, nor six eyes neither! Tell Bob there’s five ponies that have to be stabled\n",
      "\n",
      "He must find room somehow\n",
      "\n",
      "’ Nob trotted off with a grin and a wink\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well now, what was I going to say?’ said Mr# Butterbur, tapping his forehead\n",
      "\n",
      "‘One thing drives out another, so to speak\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m that busy tonight, my head is going round\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a party that came up the Greenway from down South last night – and that was strange enough to begin with\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there’s a travelling company of dwarves going West come in this evening\n",
      "\n",
      "And now there’s you\n",
      "\n",
      "If you weren’t hobbits, I doubt if we could house you\n",
      "\n",
      "But we’ve got a room or two in the north wing that were made special for hobbits, when this place was built\n",
      "\n",
      "On the ground floor as they usually prefer; round windows and all as they like it\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you’ll be comfortable\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll be wanting supper, I don’t doubt\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as may be\n",
      "\n",
      "This way now!’He led them a short way down a passage, and opened a door\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Here is a nice little parlour!’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hope it will suit\n",
      "\n",
      "Excuse me now\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m that busy\n",
      "\n",
      "No time for talking\n",
      "\n",
      "I must be trotting\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s hard work for two legs, but I don’t get thinner\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll look in again later\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want anything, ring the hand-bell, and Nob will come\n",
      "\n",
      "If he don’t come, ring and shout!’Off he went at last, and left them feeling rather breathless\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed capable of an endless stream of talk, however busy he might be\n",
      "\n",
      "They found themselves in a small and cosy room\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a bit of bright fire burning on the hearth, and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a round table, already spread with a white cloth, and on it was a large hand-bell\n",
      "\n",
      "But Nob, the hobbit servant, came bustling in long before they thought of ringing\n",
      "\n",
      "He brought candles and a tray full of plates\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Will you be wanting anything to drink, masters?’ he asked\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And shall I show you the bedrooms, while your supper is got ready?’They were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when Mr# Butterbur and Nob came in again\n",
      "\n",
      "In a twinkling the table was laid\n",
      "\n",
      "There was hot soup, cold meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves, slabs of butter, and half a ripe cheese: good plain food, as good as the Shire could show, and homelike enough to dispel the last of Sam’s misgivings (already much relieved by the excellence of the beer)\n",
      "\n",
      "The landlord hovered round for a little, and then prepared to leave them\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know whether you would care to join the company, when you have supped,’ he said, standing at the door\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Perhaps you would rather go to your beds\n",
      "\n",
      "Still the company would be very pleased to welcome you, if you had a mind\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t get Outsiders – travellers from the Shire, I should say, begging your pardon – often; and we like to hear a bit of news, or any story or song you may have in mind\n",
      "\n",
      "But as you please! Ring the bell, if you lack anything!’So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper (about three quarters of an hour’s steady going, not hindered by unnecessary talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join the company\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry said it would be too stuffy\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit, and perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air\n",
      "\n",
      "Mind your Ps and Qs, and don’t forget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret, and are still on the high-road and not very far from the Shire!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All right!’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mind yourself! Don’t get lost, and don’t forget that it is safer indoors!’The company was in the big common-room of the inn\n",
      "\n",
      "The gathering was large and mixed, as Frodo discovered, when his eyes got used to the light\n",
      "\n",
      "This came chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for the three lamps hanging from the beams were dim, and half veiled in smoke\n",
      "\n",
      "Barliman Butterbur was standing near the fire, talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two strange-looking men\n",
      "\n",
      "On the benches were various folk: men of Bree, a collection of local hobbits (sitting chattering together), a few more dwarves, and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows and corners\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the Shire-hobbits entered, there was a chorus of welcome from the Bree-landers\n",
      "\n",
      "The strangers, especially those that had come up the Greenway, stared at them curiously\n",
      "\n",
      "The landlord introduced the newcomers to the Bree-folk, so quickly that, though they caught many names, they were seldom sure who the names belonged to\n",
      "\n",
      "The Men of Bree seemed all to have rather botanical (and to the Shire-folk rather odd) names, like Rushlight, Goatleaf, Heathertoes, Appledore, Thistlewool and Ferny (not to mention Butterbur)\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the hobbits had similar names\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mugworts, for instance, seemed numerous\n",
      "\n",
      "But most of them had natural names, such as Banks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Sandheaver, and Tunnelly, many of which were used in the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "There were several Underhills from Staddle, and as they could not imagine sharing a name without being related, they took Frodo to their hearts as a long-lost cousin\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly and inquisitive, and Frodo soon found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be given\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave out that he was interested in history and geography (at which there was much wagging of heads, although neither of these words were much used in the Bree-dialect)\n",
      "\n",
      "He said he was thinking of writing a book (at which there was silent astonishment), and that he and his friends wanted to collect information about hobbits living outside the Shire, especially in the eastern lands\n",
      "\n",
      "At this a chorus of voices broke out\n",
      "\n",
      "If Frodo had really wanted to write a book, and had had many ears, he would have learned enough for several chapters in a few minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "And if that was not enough, he was given a whole list of names, beginning with ‘Old Barliman here’, to whom he could go for further information\n",
      "\n",
      "But after a time, as Frodo did not show any sign of writing a book on the spot, the hobbits returned to their questions about doings in the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo did not prove very communicative, and he soon found himself sitting alone in a corner, listening and looking around\n",
      "\n",
      "The Men and Dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling news of a kind that was becoming only too familiar\n",
      "\n",
      "There was trouble away in the South, and it seemed that the Men who had come up the Greenway were on the move, looking for lands where they could find some peace\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bree-folk were sympathetic, but plainly not very ready to take a large number of strangers into their little land\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the travellers, a squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, was foretelling that more and more people would be coming north in the near future\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If room isn’t found for them, they’ll find it for themselves\n",
      "\n",
      "They’ve a right to live, same as other folk,’ he said loudly\n",
      "\n",
      "The local inhabitants did not look pleased at the prospect\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits did not pay much attention to all this, as it did not at the moment seem to concern hobbits\n",
      "\n",
      "Big Folk could hardly beg for lodgings in hobbit-holes\n",
      "\n",
      "They were more interested in Sam and Pippin, who were now feeling quite at home, and were chatting gaily about events in the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the roof of the Town Hole in Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, the Mayor, and the fattest hobbit in the Westfarthing, had been buried in chalk, and came out like a floured dumpling\n",
      "\n",
      "But there were several questions asked that made Frodo a little uneasy\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the Bree-landers, who seemed to have been in the Shire several times, wanted to know where the Underhills lived and who they were related to\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beaten man, sitting in the shadows near the wall, was also listening intently to the hobbit-talk\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a tall tankard in front of him, and was smoking a long-stemmed pipe curiously carved\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It was a harmless enough tale for most of the local hobbits, no doubt: just a funny story about those funny people away beyond the River; but some (old Butterbur, for instance) knew a thing or two, and had probably heard rumours long ago about Bilbo’s vanishing\n",

      "\n",
      "He resisted the temptation firmly, and clasped the Ring in his hand, as if to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate it gave him no inspiration\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke ‘a few suitable words’, as they would have said in the Shire: We are all very much gratified by the kindness of your reception, and I venture to hope that my brief visit will help to renew the old ties of\n",

      "For a moment he wondered if the Ring itself had not played him a trick; perhaps it had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt in the room\n",

      "Then he shut it quietly and sat down again\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have quick ears,’ he went on, lowering his voice, ‘and though I cannot disappear, I have hunted many wild and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen, if I wish\n",

      "He was very close with one of the Southern strangers, and they slipped out together just after your “accident”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all of those Southerners mean well; and as for Ferny, he would sell anything to anybody; or make mischief for amusement\n",

      "\n",
      "It seems to me only too likely that they will hear of it before this night is over\n",
      "\n",
      "Is that enough? You can do as you like about my reward: take me as a guide or not\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Do you wish them to find you? They are terrible!’The hobbits looked at him, and saw with surprise that his face was drawn as if with pain, and his hands clenched the arms of his chair\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to have grown dim\n",
      "\n",
      "For a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening to sounds in the Night far away\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Sam frowned, and looked at his master; and at last he broke out:‘With your leave, Mr# Frodo, I’d say no! This Strider here, he warns and he says take care; and I say yes to that, and let’s begin with him\n",
      "\n",
      "He comes out of the Wild, and I never heard no good of such folk\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows something, that’s plain, and more than I like; but it’s no reason why we should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help, as he puts it\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "Frodo caught his glance and looked away\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "You began to talk to me like the Bree-folk, but your voice has changed\n",
      "\n",
      "Still Sam seems right in this: I don’t see why you should warn us to take care, and yet ask us to take you on trust\n",
      "\n",
      "Why the disguise? Who are you? What do you really know about – about my business; and how do you know it?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The lesson in caution has been well learned,’ said Strider with a grim smile\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But caution is one thing and wavering is another\n",
      "\n",
      "You will never get to Rivendell now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance\n",

      "Mr# Butterbur had arrived with candles, and behind him was Nob with cans of hot water\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider withdrew into a dark corner\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’ve come to bid you good night,’ said the landlord, putting the candles on the table\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nob! Take the water to the rooms!’ He came in and shut the door\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s like this,’ he began, hesitating and looking troubled\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If I’ve done any harm, I’m sorry indeed\n",

      "But one thing drives out another, as you’ll admit; and I’m a busy man\n",
      "\n",
      "But first one thing and then another this week have jogged my memory, as the saying goes; and not too late I hope\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, I was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire, and for one by the name of Baggins in particular\n",
      "\n",
      "And what has that got to do with me?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah! you know best,’ said the landlord, knowingly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I won’t give you away; but I was told that this Baggins would be going by the name of Underhill, and I was given a description that fits you well enough, if I may say so\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Indeed! Let’s have it then!’ said Frodo, unwisely interrupting\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A stout little fellow with red cheeks,’ said Mr# Butterbur solemnly\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin chuckled, but Sam looked indignant\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That won’t help you much; it goes for most hobbits, Barley, he says to me,’ continued Mr# Butterbur with a glance at Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But this one is taller than some and fairer than most, and he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye\n",
      "\n",
      "Begging your pardon, but he said it, not me\n",
      "\n",
      "He said it? And who was he?’ asked Frodo eagerly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean\n",
      "\n",
      "A wizard they say he is, but he’s a good friend of mine, whether or no\n",
      "\n",
      "But now I don’t know what he’ll have to say to me, if I see him again: turn all my ale sour or me into a block of wood, I shouldn’t wonder\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s a bit hasty\n",
      "\n",
      "Still what’s done can’t be undone\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, what have you done?’ said Frodo, getting impatient with the slow unravelling of Butterbur’s thoughts\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where was I?’ said the landlord, pausing and snapping his fingers\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah, yes! Old Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "Three months back he walked right into my room without a knock\n",
      "\n",
      "Barley, he says, I’m off in the morning\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you do something for me? You’ve only to name it, I said\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m in a hurry, said he, and I’ve no time myself, but I want a message took to the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you anyone you can send, and trust to go? I can find someone, I said, tomorrow, maybe, or the day after\n",
      "\n",
      "Make it tomorrow, he says, and then he gave me a letter\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s addressed plain enough,’ said Mr# Butterbur, producing a letter from his pocket, and reading out the address slowly and proudly (he valued his reputation as a lettered man):Mr# FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A letter for me from Gandalf!’ cried Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah!’ said Mr# Butterbur\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then your right name is Baggins?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is,’ said Frodo, ‘and you had better give me that letter at once, and explain why you never sent it\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s what you came to tell me, I suppose, though you’ve taken a long time to come to the point\n",
      "\n",
      "’Poor Mr# Butterbur looked troubled\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You’re right, master,’ he said, ‘and I beg your pardon\n",
      "\n",
      "And I’m mortal afraid of what Gandalf will say, if harm comes of it\n",
      "\n",
      "But I didn’t keep it back a-purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "I put it by safe\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I couldn’t find nobody willing to go to the Shire next day, nor the day after, and none of my own folk were to spare; and then one thing after another drove it out of my mind\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m a busy man\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll do what I can to set matters right, and if there’s any help I can give, you’ve only to name it\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less\n",
      "\n",
      "Barley, he says to me, this friend of mine from the Shire, he may be coming out this way before long, him and another\n",
      "\n",
      "He’ll be calling himself Underhill\n",
      "\n",
      "Mind that! But you need ask no questions\n",
      "\n",
      "And if I’m not with him, he may be in trouble, and he may need help\n",
      "\n",
      "Do whatever you can for him, and I’ll be grateful, he says\n",
      "\n",
      "And here you are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘These black men,’ said the landlord lowering his voice\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They’re looking for Baggins, and if they mean well, then I’m a hobbit\n",
      "\n",

      "Uncanny, I called it\n",

      "\n",
      "Nob’s hair was all stood on end\n",
      "\n",
      "I bid the black fellows be off, and slammed the door on them; but they’ve been asking the same question all the way to Archet, I hear\n",
      "\n",
      "And that Ranger, Strider, he’s been asking questions, too\n",
      "\n",
      "Tried to get in here to see you, before you’d had bite or sup, he did\n",
      "\n",
      "He did!’ said Strider suddenly, coming forward into the light\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And much trouble would have been saved, if you had let him in, Barliman\n",
      "\n",
      "’The landlord jumped with surprise\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You!’ he cried\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You’re always popping up\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you want now?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He’s here with my leave,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He came to offer me his help\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, you know your own business, maybe,’ said Mr# Butterbur, looking suspiciously at Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But if I was in your plight, I wouldn’t take up with a Ranger\n",
      "\n",
      "Then who would you take up with?’ asked Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A fat innkeeper who only remembers his own name because people shout it at him all day? They cannot stay in The Pony for ever, and they cannot go home\n",
      "\n",
      "They have a long road before them\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you go with them and keep the black men off?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn’t do that for any money,’ said Mr# Butterbur, looking really scared\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But why can’t you stay here quiet for a bit, Mr# Underhill? What are all these queer goings on? What are these black men after, and where do they come from, I’d like to know?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’m sorry I can’t explain it all,’ answered Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am tired and very worried, and it’s a long tale\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you mean to help me, I ought to warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house\n",
      "\n",
      "These Black Riders: I am not sure, but I think, I fear they come from——’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They come from Mordor,’ said Strider in a low voice\n",
      "\n",
      "‘From Mordor, Barliman, if that means anything to you\n",
      "\n",
      "Save us!’ cried Mr# Butterbur turning pale; the name evidently was known to him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is the worst news that has come to Bree in my time\n",
      "\n",
      "It is,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Are you still willing to help me?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am,’ said Mr# Butterbur\n",

      "‘More than ever\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I don’t know what the likes of me can do against, against——’ he faltered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Against the Shadow in the East,’ said Strider quietly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not much, Barliman, but every little helps\n",
      "\n",
      "You can let Mr# Underhill stay here tonight, as Mr# Underhill; and you can forget the name of Baggins, till he is far away\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll do that,’ said Butterbur\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But they’ll find out he’s here without help from me, I’m afraid\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a pity Mr# Baggins drew attention to himself this evening, to say no more\n",
      "\n",
      "The story of that Mr# Bilbo’s going off has been heard before tonight in Bree\n",
      "\n",
      "Even our Nob has been doing some guessing in his slow pate; and there are others in Bree quicker in the uptake than he is\n",

      "We shall have a rough road tomorrow\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if we are allowed to leave Bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed\n",

      "\n",
      "‘It is a hill, just to the north of the Road, about half way from here to Rivendell\n",
      "\n",
      "It commands a wide view all round; and there we shall have a chance to look about us\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us\n",
      "\n",
      "After Weathertop our journey will become more difficult, and we shall have to choose between various dangers\n",
      "\n",
      "When did you last see Gandalf?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you know where he is, or what he is doing?’Strider looked grave\n",

      "We last met on the first of May: at Sarn Ford down the Brandywine\n",
      "\n",
      "He told me that his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for Rivendell in the last week of September\n",
      "\n",
      "As I knew he was at your side, I went away on a journey of my own\n",
      "\n",
      "And that has proved ill; for plainly some news reached him, and I was not at hand to help\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am troubled, for the first time since I have known him\n",
      "\n",
      "We should have had messages, even if he could not come himself\n",

      "When I returned, many days ago, I heard the ill news\n",
      "\n",
      "The tidings had gone far and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the Elven-folk of Gildor that told me this; and later they told me that you had left your home; but there was no news of your leaving Buckland\n",

      "I have been watching the East Road anxiously\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it – with Gandalf ’s absence, I mean?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not know of anything else that could have hindered him, except the Enemy himself,’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But do not give up hope! Gandalf is greater than you Shire-folk know – as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys\n",

      "He shut the door hastily, and leaned against it\n",

      "He was out of breath\n",
      "\n",
      "They stared at him in alarm for a moment before he gasped: ‘I have seen them, Frodo! I have seen them! Black Riders!’\n",

      "Suddenly I shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a sort of deeper shade among the shadows across the road, just beyond the edge of the lamplight\n",

      "It slid away at once into the dark without a sound\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no horse\n",

      "\n",
      "I couldn’t hear a word that was said\n",

      "I did not creep any closer, because I began to tremble all over\n",

      "Just nigh Bill Ferny’s house I thought I could see something in the Road\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn’t swear to it, but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over something, lifting it\n",
      "\n",
      "I gave a shout, but when I got up to the spot there was no signs of them, and only Mr# Brandybuck lying by the roadside\n",

      "As he stared out into the gloom, a black shadow moved under the trees; the gate seemed to open of its own accord and close again without a sound\n",
      "\n",
      "Terror seized him\n",
      "\n",
      "He shrank back, and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he shut and locked the door\n",
      "\n",
      "The night deepened\n",
      "\n",
      "There came the soft sound of horses led with stealth along the lane\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside the gate they stopped, and three black figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground\n",
      "\n",
      "One went to the door, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they stood, as still as the shadows of stones, while night went slowly on\n",
      "\n",
      "The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a cock crowed far away\n",
      "\n",
      "The cold hour before dawn was passing\n",
      "\n",
      "The figure by the door moved\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed, as if a chill light had been unsheathed\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the door shuddered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Open, in the name of Mordor!’ said a voice thin and menacing\n",
      "\n",
      "At a second blow the door yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and lock broken\n",
      "\n",
      "The black figures passed swiftly in\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, among the trees nearby, a horn rang out\n",
      "\n",
      "It rent the night like fire on a hill-top\n",
      "\n",
      "AWAKE! FEAR! FIRE! FOES! AWAKE!Fatty Bolger had not been idle\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he saw the dark shapes creep from the garden, he knew that he must run for it, or perish\n",
      "\n",
      "And run he did, out of the back door, through the garden, and over the fields\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached the nearest house, more than a mile away, he collapsed on the doorstep\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, no, no!’ he was crying\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, not me! I haven’t got it!’ It was some time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about\n",
      "\n",
      "At last they got the idea that enemies were in Buckland, some strange invasion from the Old Forest\n",
      "\n",
      "And then they lost no more time\n",
      "\n",
      "FEAR! FIRE! FOES!The Brandybucks were blowing the Horn-call of Buckland, that had not been sounded for a hundred years, not since the white wolves came in the Fell Winter, when the Brandywine was frozen over\n",
      "\n",
      "AWAKE! AWAKE!Far away answering horns were heard\n",
      "\n",
      "The alarm was spreading\n",

      "\n",
      "In the lane the noise of hoofs broke out, and gathering to a gallop, went hammering away into the darkness\n",
      "\n",
      "All about Crickhollow there was the sound of horns blowing, and voices crying and feet running\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Black Riders rode like a gale to the North-gate\n",
      "\n",
      "Let the little people blow! Sauron would deal with them later\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile they had another errand: they knew now that the house was empty and the Ring had gone\n",
      "\n",
      "They rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early night Frodo woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as if some sound or presence had disturbed him\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw that Strider was sitting alert in his chair: his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire, which had been tended and was burning brightly; but he made no sign or movement\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo soon went to sleep again; but his dreams were again troubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind seemed to be curling round the house and shaking it; and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened his eyes, and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn-yard\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang\n",
      "\n",
      "The first grey light of day was in the room, and a cold air was coming through the open window\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Strider had roused them all, he led the way to their bedrooms\n",
      "\n",
      "When they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice: the windows had been forced open and were swinging, and the curtains were flapping; the beds were tossed about, and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the floor; the brown mat was torn to pieces\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider immediately went to fetch the landlord\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Mr# Butterbur looked sleepy and frightened\n",
      "\n",
      "He had hardly closed his eyes all night (so he said), but he had never heard a sound\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Never has such a thing happened in my time!’ he cried, raising his hands in horror\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Guests unable to sleep in their beds, and good bolsters ruined and all! What are we coming to?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Dark times,’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But for the present you may be left in peace, when you have got rid of us\n",
      "\n",
      "We will leave at once\n",
      "\n",
      "Never mind about breakfast: a drink and a bite standing will have to do\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall be packed in a few minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "’Mr# Butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready, and to fetch them a ‘bite’\n",
      "\n",
      "But very soon he came back in dismay\n",
      "\n",
      "The ponies had vanished! The stable-doors had all been opened in the night, and they were gone: not only Merry’s ponies, but every other horse and beast in the place\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo was crushed by the news\n",
      "\n",
      "How could they hope to reach Rivendell on foot, pursued by mounted enemies? They might as well set out for the Moon\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider sat silent for a while, looking at the hobbits, as if he was weighing up their strength and courage\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen,’ he said at last, thoughtfully, as if he guessed what Frodo had in mind\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We should not go much slower on foot, not on the roads that I mean to take\n",
      "\n",
      "I was going to walk in any case\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the food and stores that trouble me\n",
      "\n",
      "We cannot count on getting anything to eat between here and Rivendell, except what we take with us; and we ought to take plenty to spare; for we may be delayed, or forced to go round-about, far out of the direct way\n",
      "\n",
      "How much are you prepared to carry on your backs?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘As much as we must,’ said Pippin with a sinking heart, but trying to show that he was tougher than he looked (or felt)\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can carry enough for two,’ said Sam defiantly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Can’t anything be done, Mr# Butterbur?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Can’t we get a couple of ponies in the village, or even one just for the baggage? I don’t suppose we could hire them, but we might be able to buy them,’ he added, doubtfully, wondering if he could afford it\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I doubt it,’ said the landlord unhappily\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The two or three riding-ponies that there were in Bree were stabled in my yard, and they’re gone\n",
      "\n",
      "As for other animals, horses or ponies for draught or what not, there are very few of them in Bree, and they won’t be for sale\n",
      "\n",
      "But I’ll do what I can\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll rout out Bob and send him round as soon as may be\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes,’ said Strider reluctantly, ‘you had better do that\n",
      "\n",
      "I am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at least\n",
      "\n",
      "But so ends all hope of starting early, and slipping away quietly! We might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure\n",
      "\n",
      "That was part of their plan, no doubt\n",
      "\n",
      "There is one crumb of comfort,’ said Merry, ‘and more than a crumb, I hope: we can have breakfast while we wait – and sit down to it\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s get hold of Nob!’In the end there was more than three hours’ delay\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob came back with the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the neighbourhood – except one: Bill Ferny had one that he might possibly sell\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A poor old half-starved creature it is,’ said Bob; ‘but he won’t part with it for less than thrice its worth, seeing how you’re placed, not if I knows Bill Ferny\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill Ferny?’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Isn’t there some trick? Wouldn’t the beast bolt back to him with all our stuff, or help in tracking us, or something?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wonder,’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I cannot imagine any animal running home to him, once it got away\n",
      "\n",
      "I fancy this is only an afterthought of kind Master Ferny’s: just a way of increasing his profits from the affair\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at death’s door\n",
      "\n",
      "But there does not seem any choice\n",
      "\n",
      "What does he want for it?’Bill Ferny’s price was twelve silver pennies; and that was indeed at least three times the pony’s value in those parts\n",
      "\n",
      "It proved to be a bony, underfed, and dispirited animal; but it did not look like dying just yet\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr# Butterbur paid for it himself, and offered Merry another eighteen pence as some compensation for the lost animals\n",
      "\n",
      "He was an honest man, and well-off as things were reckoned in Bree; but thirty silver pennies was a sore blow to him, and being cheated by Bill Ferny made it harder to bear\n",
      "\n",
      "As a matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end\n",
      "\n",
      "It turned out later that only one horse had been actually stolen\n",
      "\n",
      "The others had been driven off, or had bolted in terror, and were found wandering in different corners of the Bree-land\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry’s ponies had escaped altogether, and eventually (having a good deal of sense) they made their way to the Downs in search of Fatty Lumpkin\n",
      "\n",
      "So they came under the care of Tom Bombadil for a while, and were well-off\n",
      "\n",
      "But when news of the events at Bree came to Tom’s ears, he sent them to Mr# Butterbur, who thus got five good beasts at a very fair price\n",
      "\n",
      "They had to work harder in Bree, but Bob treated them well; so on the whole they were lucky: they missed a dark and dangerous journey\n",
      "\n",
      "But they never came to Rivendell\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in the meanwhile for all Mr# Butterbur knew his money was gone for good, or for bad\n",
      "\n",
      "And he had other troubles\n",
      "\n",
      "For there was a great commotion as soon as the remaining guests were astir and heard news of the raid on the inn\n",
      "\n",
      "The southern travellers had lost several horses and blamed the innkeeper loudly, until it became known that one of their own number had also disappeared in the night, none other than Bill Ferny’s squint-eyed companion\n",
      "\n",
      "Suspicion fell on him at once\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you pick up with a horse-thief, and bring him to my house,’ said Butterbur angrily, ‘you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and not come shouting at me\n",
      "\n",
      "Go and ask Ferny where your handsome friend is!’ But it appeared that he was nobody’s friend, and nobody could recollect when he had joined their party\n",
      "\n",
      "After their breakfast the hobbits had to re-pack, and get together further supplies for the longer journey they were now expecting\n",
      "\n",
      "It was close on ten o’clock before they at last got off\n",
      "\n",
      "By that time the whole of Bree was buzzing with excitement\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo’s vanishing trick; the appearance of the black horsemen; the robbing of the stables; and not least the news that Strider the Ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits, made such a tale as would last for many uneventful years\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the inhabitants of Bree and Staddle, and many even from Combe and Archet, were crowded in the road to see the travellers start\n",
      "\n",
      "The other guests in the inn were at the doors or hanging out of the windows\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider had changed his mind, and had decided to leave Bree by the main road\n",
      "\n",
      "Any attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters worse: half the inhabitants would follow them, to see what they were up to, and to prevent them from trespassing\n",
      "\n",
      "They said farewell to Nob and Bob, and took leave of Mr# Butterbur with many thanks\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hope we shall meet again some day, when things are merry once more,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I should like nothing better than to stay in your house in peace for a while\n",
      "\n",
      "’They tramped off, anxious and downhearted, under the eyes of the crowd\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all the faces were friendly, nor all the words that were shouted\n",
      "\n",
      "But Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the Bree-landers, and those that he stared at shut their mouths and drew away\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked in front with Frodo; next came Merry and Pippin; and last came Sam leading the pony, which was laden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it; but already it looked less dejected, as if it approved of the change in its fortunes\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a pocket full of them: a parting present from Nob and Bob\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Apples for walking, and a pipe for sitting,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I reckon I’ll miss them both before long\n",
      "\n",
      "’The hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped out of doors, or popped over walls and fences, as they passed\n",
      "\n",
      "But as they drew near to the further gate, Frodo saw a dark ill-kept house behind a thick hedge: the last house in the village\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of the windows he caught a glimpse of a sallow face with sly, slanting eyes; but it vanished at once\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So that’s where that southerner is hiding!’ he thought\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He looks more than half like a goblin\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the hedge another man was staring boldly\n",
      "\n",
      "He had heavy black brows, and dark scornful eyes; his large mouth curled in a sneer\n",
      "\n",
      "He was smoking a short black pipe\n",
      "\n",
      "As they approached he took it out of his mouth and spat\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Morning, Longshanks!’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Off early? Found some friends at last?’ Strider nodded, but did not answer\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Morning, my little friends!’ he said to the others\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I suppose you know who you’ve taken up with? That’s Stick-at-naught Strider, that is! Though I’ve heard other names not so pretty\n",
      "\n",
      "Watch out tonight! And you, Sammie, don’t go ill-treating my poor old pony! Pah!’ He spat again\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam turned quickly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And you, Ferny,’ he said, ‘put your ugly face out of sight, or it will get hurt\n",
      "\n",
      "’ With a sudden flick, quick as lightning, an apple left his hand and hit Bill square on the nose\n",
      "\n",
      "He ducked too late, and curses came from behind the hedge\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Waste of a good apple,’ said Sam regretfully, and strode on\n",
      "\n",
      "At last they left the village behind\n",
      "\n",
      "The escort of children and stragglers that had followed them got tired and turned back at the South-gate\n",
      "\n",
      "Passing through, they kept on along the Road for some miles\n",
      "\n",
      "It bent to the left, curving back into its eastward line as it rounded the feet of Bree-hill, and then it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded country\n",
      "\n",
      "To their left they could see some of the houses and hobbit-holes of Staddle on the gentler south-eastern slopes of the hill; down in a deep hollow away north of the Road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed where Combe lay; Archet was hidden in the trees beyond\n",
      "\n",
      "After the Road had run down some way, and had left Bree-hill standing tall and brown behind, they came on a narrow track that led off towards the North\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is where we leave the open and take to cover,’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not a “short cut”, I hope,’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disaster\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, but you had not got me with you then,’ laughed Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My cuts, short or long, don’t go wrong\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He took a look up and down the Road\n",
      "\n",
      "No one was in sight; and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley\n",
      "\n",
      "His plan, as far as they could understand it without knowing the country, was to go towards Archet at first, but to bear right and pass it on the east, and then to steer as straight as he could over the wild lands to Weathertop Hill\n",
      "\n",
      "In that way they would, if all went well, cut off a great loop of the Road, which further on bent southwards to avoid the Midgewater Marshes\n",
      "\n",
      "But, of course, they would have to pass through the marshes themselves, and Strider’s description of them was not encouraging\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in the meanwhile, walking was not unpleasant\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, if it had not been for the disturbing events of the night before, they would have enjoyed this part of the journey better than any up to that time\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was shining, clear but not too hot\n",
      "\n",
      "The woods in the valley were still leafy and full of colour, and seemed peaceful and wholesome\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider guided them confidently among the many crossing paths, although left to themselves they would soon have been at a loss\n",
      "\n",
      "He was taking a wandering course with many turns and doublings, to put off any pursuit\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bill Ferny will have watched where we left the Road, for certain,’ he said; ‘though I don’t think he will follow us himself\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows the land round here well enough, but he knows he is not a match for me in a wood\n",
      "\n",
      "It is what he may tell others that I am afraid of\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t suppose they are far away\n",
      "\n",
      "If they think we have made for Archet, so much the better\n",
      "\n",
      "’Whether because of Strider’s skill or for some other reason, they saw no sign and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day: neither two-footed, except birds; nor four-footed, except one fox and a few squirrels\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day they began to steer a steady course eastwards; and still all was quiet and peaceful\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third day out from Bree they came out of the Chetwood\n",
      "\n",
      "The land had been falling steadily, ever since they turned aside from the Road, and they now entered a wide flat expanse of country, much more difficult to manage\n",
      "\n",
      "They were far beyond the borders of the Bree-land, out in the pathless wilderness, and drawing near to the Midgewater Marshes\n",
      "\n",
      "The ground now became damp, and in places boggy and here and there they came upon pools, and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the warbling of little hidden birds\n",
      "\n",
      "They had to pick their way carefully to keep both dry-footed and on their proper course\n",
      "\n",
      "At first they made fair progress, but as they went on, their passage became slower and more dangerous\n",
      "\n",
      "The marshes were bewildering and treacherous, and there was no permanent trail even for Rangers to find through their shifting quagmires\n",
      "\n",
      "The flies began to torment them, and the air was full of clouds of tiny midges that crept up their sleeves and breeches and into their hair\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am being eaten alive!’ cried Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Midgewater! There are more midges than water!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do they live on when they can’t get hobbit?’ asked Sam, scratching his neck\n",
      "\n",
      "They spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country\n",
      "\n",
      "Their camping-place was damp, cold, and uncomfortable; and the biting insects would not let them sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "There were also abominable creatures haunting the reeds and tussocks that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the cricket\n",
      "\n",
      "There were thousands of them, and they squeaked all round, neek-breek, breek-neek, unceasingly all the night, until the hobbits were nearly frantic\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, the fourth, was little better, and the night almost as comfortless\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the Neekerbreekers (as Sam called them) had been left behind, the midges still pursued them\n",
      "\n",
      "As Frodo lay, tired but unable to close his eyes, it seemed to him that far away there came a light in the eastern sky: it flashed and faded many times\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not the dawn, for that was still some hours off\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is the light?’ he said to Strider, who had risen, and was standing, gazing ahead into the night\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not know,’ Strider answered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is too distant to make out\n",
      "\n",
      "It is like lightning that leaps up from the hill-tops\n",
      "\n",
      "’Frodo lay down again, but for a long while he could still see the white flashes, and against them the tall dark figure of Strider, standing silent and watchful\n",
      "\n",
      "At last he passed into uneasy sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last straggling pools and reed-beds of the marshes behind them\n",
      "\n",
      "The land before them began steadily to rise again\n",
      "\n",
      "Away in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hills\n",
      "\n",
      "The highest of them was at the right of the line and a little separated from the others\n",
      "\n",
      "It had a conical top, slightly flattened at the summit\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is Weathertop,’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Old Road, which we have left far away on our right, runs to the south of it and passes not far from its foot\n",
      "\n",
      "We might reach it by noon tomorrow, if we go straight towards it\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose we had better do so\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I mean: when we do get there, it is not certain what we shall find\n",
      "\n",
      "It is close to the Road\n",
      "\n",
      "But surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes; but the hope is faint\n",
      "\n",
      "If he comes this way at all, he may not pass through Bree, and so he may not know what we are doing\n",
      "\n",
      "And anyway, unless by luck we arrive almost together, we shall miss one another; it will not be safe for him or for us to wait there long\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Riders fail to find us in the wilderness, they are likely to make for Weathertop themselves\n",
      "\n",
      "It commands a wide view all round\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, there are many birds and beasts in this country that could see us, as we stand here, from that hill-top\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all the birds are to be trusted, and there are other spies more evil than they are\n",
      "\n",
      "’The hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam looked up into the pale sky, fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome, Strider!’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you advise us to do?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think,’ answered Strider slowly, as if he was not quite sure, ‘I think the best thing is to go as straight eastward from here as we can, to make for the line of hills, not for Weathertop\n",
      "\n",
      "There we can strike a path I know that runs at their feet; it will bring us to Weathertop from the north and less openly\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we shall see what we shall see\n",
      "\n",
      "’All that day they plodded along, until the cold and early evening came down\n",
      "\n",
      "The land became drier and more barren; but mists and vapours lay behind them on the marshes\n",
      "\n",
      "A few melancholy birds were piping and wailing, until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows; then an empty silence fell\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful windows of Bag End far away\n",
      "\n",
      "At the day’s end they came to a stream that wandered down from the hills to lose itself in the stagnant marshland, and they went up along its banks while the light lasted\n",
      "\n",
      "It was already night when at last they halted and made their camp under some stunted alder-trees by the shores of the stream\n",
      "\n",
      "Ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak and treeless backs of the hills\n",
      "\n",
      "That night they set a watch, and Strider, it seemed, did not sleep at all\n",
      "\n",
      "The moon was waxing, and in the early night-hours a cold grey light lay on the land\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning they set out again soon after sunrise\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a frost in the air, and the sky was a pale clear blue\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits felt refreshed, as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "Already they were getting used to much walking on short commons – shorter at any rate than what in the Shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin declared that Frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very odd,’ said Frodo, tightening his belt, ‘considering that there is actually a good deal less of me\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope the thinning process will not go on indefinitely, or I shall become a wraith\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not speak of such things!’ said Strider quickly, and with surprising earnestness\n",
      "\n",
      "The hills drew nearer\n",
      "\n",
      "They made an undulating ridge, often rising almost to a thousand feet, and here and there falling again to low clefts or passes leading into the eastern land beyond\n",
      "\n",
      "Along the crest of the ridge the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of green-grown walls and dikes, and in the clefts there still stood the ruins of old works of stone\n",
      "\n",
      "By night they had reached the feet of the westward slopes, and there they camped\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the night of the fifth of October, and they were six days out from Bree\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning they found, for the first time since they had left the Chetwood, a track plain to see\n",
      "\n",
      "They turned right and followed it southwards\n",
      "\n",
      "It ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep as much hidden as possible from the view, both of the hill-tops above and of the flats to the west\n",
      "\n",
      "It dived into dells, and hugged steep banks; and where it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there were lines of large boulders and hewn stones that screened the travellers almost like a hedge\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wonder who made this path, and what for,’ said Merry, as they walked along one of these avenues, where the stones were unusually large and closely set\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am not sure that I like it: it has a – well, rather a barrow-wightish look\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any barrow on Weathertop?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no barrow on Weathertop, nor on any of these hills,’ answered Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Men of the West did not live here; though in their latter days they defended the hills for a while against the evil that came out of Angmar\n",
      "\n",
      "This path was made to serve the forts along the walls\n",
      "\n",
      "But long before, in the first days of the North Kingdom, they built a great watch-tower on Weathertop, Amon Sûl they called it\n",
      "\n",
      "It was burned and broken, and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring, like a rough crown on the old hill’s head\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet once it was tall and fair\n",
      "\n",
      "It is told that Elendil stood there watching for the coming of Gil-galad out of the West, in the days of the Last Alliance\n",
      "\n",
      "’The hobbits gazed at Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed that he was learned in old lore, as well as in the ways of the wild\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who was Gil-galad?’ asked Merry; but Strider did not answer, and seemed to be lost in thought\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly a low voice murmured:Gil-galad was an Elven-king\n",
      "\n",
      "Of him the harpers sadly sing:\n",
      "\n",
      "the last whose realm was fair and free\n",
      "\n",
      "between the Mountains and the Sea\n",
      "\n",
      "His sword was long, his lance was keen,\n",
      "\n",
      "his shining helm afar was seen;\n",
      "\n",
      "the countless stars of heaven’s field\n",
      "\n",
      "were mirrored in his silver shield\n",
      "\n",
      "But long ago he rode away,\n",
      "\n",
      "and where he dwelleth none can say;\n",
      "\n",
      "for into darkness fell his star\n",
      "\n",
      "in Mordor where the shadows are\n",
      "\n",
      "The others turned in amazement, for the voice was Sam’s\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t stop!’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s all I know,’ stammered Sam, blushing\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I learned it from Mr# Bilbo when I was a lad\n",
      "\n",
      "He used to tell me tales like that, knowing how I was always one for hearing about Elves\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Mr# Bilbo as taught me my letters\n",
      "\n",
      "He was mighty book-learned was dear old Mr# Bilbo\n",
      "\n",
      "And he wrote poetry\n",
      "\n",
      "He wrote what I have just said\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not make it up,’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is part of the lay that is called The Fall of Gil-galad, which is in an ancient tongue\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo must have translated it\n",
      "\n",
      "I never knew that\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There was a lot more,’ said Sam, ‘all about Mordor\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t learn that part, it gave me the shivers\n",
      "\n",
      "I never thought I should be going that way myself!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Going to Mordor!’ cried Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hope it won’t come to that!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do not speak that name so loudly!’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "It was already mid-day when they drew near the southern end of the path, and saw before them, in the pale clear light of the October sun, a grey-green bank, leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the hill\n",
      "\n",
      "They decided to make for the top at once, while the daylight was broad\n",
      "\n",
      "Concealment was no longer possible, and they could only hope that no enemy or spy was observing them\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing was to be seen moving on the hill\n",
      "\n",
      "If Gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him\n",
      "\n",
      "On the western flank of Weathertop they found a sheltered hollow, at the bottom of which there was a bowl-shaped dell with grassy sides\n",
      "\n",
      "There they left Sam and Pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage\n",
      "\n",
      "The other three went on\n",
      "\n",
      "After half an hour’s plodding climb Strider reached the crown of the hill; Frodo and Merry followed, tired and breathless\n",
      "\n",
      "The last slope had been steep and rocky\n",
      "\n",
      "On the top they found, as Strider had said, a wide ring of ancient stone-work, now crumbling or covered with age-long grass\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the centre a cairn of broken stones had been piled\n",
      "\n",
      "They were blackened as if with fire\n",
      "\n",
      "About them the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled, as if flames had swept the hilltop; but there was no sign of any living thing\n",
      "\n",
      "Standing upon the rim of the ruined circle, they saw all round below them a wide prospect, for the most part of lands empty and featureless, except for patches of woodland away to the south, beyond which they caught here and there the glint of distant water\n",
      "\n",
      "Beneath them on this southern side there ran like a ribbon the Old Road, coming out of the West and winding up and down, until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing was moving on it\n",
      "\n",
      "Following its line eastward with their eyes they saw the Mountains: the nearer foothills were brown and sombre; behind them stood taller shapes of grey, and behind those again were high white peaks glimmering among the clouds\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, here we are!’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And very cheerless and uninviting it looks! There is no water and no shelter\n",
      "\n",
      "And no sign of Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "But I don’t blame him for not waiting – if he ever came here\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder,’ said Strider, looking round thoughtfully\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Even if he was a day or two behind us at Bree, he could have arrived here first\n",
      "\n",
      "He can ride very swiftly when need presses\n",
      "\n",
      "’ Suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone on the top of the cairn; it was flatter than the others, and whiter, as if it had escaped the fire\n",
      "\n",
      "He picked it up and examined it, turning it in his fingers\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This has been handled recently,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you think of these marks?’On the flat under-side Frodo saw some scratches:  ‘There seems to be a stroke, a dot, and three more strokes,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The stroke on the left might be a G-rune with thin branches,’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It might be a sign left by Gandalf, though one cannot be sure\n",
      "\n",
      "The scratches are fine, and they certainly look fresh\n",
      "\n",
      "But the marks might mean something quite different, and have nothing to do with us\n",
      "\n",
      "Rangers use runes, and they come here sometimes\n",
      "\n",
      "What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?’ asked Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I should say,’ answered Strider, ‘that they stood for G3, and were a sign that Gandalf was here on October the third: that is three days ago now\n",
      "\n",
      "It would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand, so that he had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer\n",
      "\n",
      "If that is so, we must be wary\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish we could feel sure that he made the marks, whatever they may mean,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It would be a great comfort to know that he was on the way, in front of us or behind us\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps,’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘For myself, I believe that he was here, and was in danger\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been scorching flames here; and now the light that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess that he was attacked on this hill-top, but with what result I cannot tell\n",
      "\n",
      "He is here no longer, and we must now look after ourselves and make our own way to Rivendell, as best we can\n",
      "\n",
      "How far is Rivendell?’ asked Merry, gazing round wearily\n",
      "\n",
      "The world looked wild and wide from Weathertop\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know if the Road has ever been measured in miles beyond the Forsaken Inn, a day’s journey east of Bree,’ answered Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Some say it is so far, and some say otherwise\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a strange road, and folk are glad to reach their journey’s end, whether the time is long or short\n",
      "\n",
      "But I know how long it would take me on my own feet, with fair weather and no ill fortune: twelve days from here to the Ford of Bruinen, where the Road crosses the Loudwater that runs out of Rivendell\n",
      "\n",
      "We have at least a fortnight’s journey before us, for I do not think we shall be able to use the Road\n",
      "\n",
      "A fortnight!’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A lot may happen in that time\n",
      "\n",
      "It may,’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "They stood for a while silent on the hill-top, near its southward edge\n",
      "\n",
      "In that lonely place Frodo for the first time fully realized his homelessness and danger\n",
      "\n",
      "He wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in the quiet and beloved Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "He stared down at the hateful Road, leading back westward – to his home\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving slowly along it, going westward; and looking again he saw that three others were creeping eastward to meet them\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave a cry and clutched Strider’s arm\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Look,’ he said, pointing downwards\n",
      "\n",
      "At once Strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle, pulling Frodo down beside him\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry threw himself alongside\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is it?’ he whispered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not know, but I fear the worst,’ answered Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again, and peered through a cleft between two jagged stones\n",
      "\n",
      "The light was no longer bright, for the clear morning had faded, and clouds creeping out of the East had now overtaken the sun, as it began to go down\n",
      "\n",
      "They could all see the black specks, but neither Frodo nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain; yet something told them that there, far below, were Black Riders assembling on the Road beyond the foot of the hill\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Strider, whose keener sight left him in no doubt\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The enemy is here!’Hastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to find their companions\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam and Peregrin had not been idle\n",
      "\n",
      "They had explored the small dell and the surrounding slopes\n",
      "\n",
      "Not far away they found a spring of clear water in the hillside, and near it footprints not more than a day or two old\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dell itself they found recent traces of a fire, and other signs of a hasty camp\n",
      "\n",
      "There were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to the hill\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind them Sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly stacked\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,’ he said to Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Whoever it was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems\n",
      "\n",
      "’Strider was greatly interested in these discoveries\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wish I had waited and explored the ground down here myself,’ he said, hurrying off to the spring to examine the footprints\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is just as I feared,’ he said, when he came back\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sam and Pippin have trampled the soft ground, and the marks are spoilt or confused\n",
      "\n",
      "Rangers have been here lately\n",
      "\n",
      "It is they who left the firewood behind\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are also several newer tracks that were not made by Rangers\n",
      "\n",
      "At least one set was made, only a day or two ago, by heavy boots\n",
      "\n",
      "At least one\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot now be certain, but I think there were many booted feet\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He paused and stood in anxious thought\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted Riders\n",
      "\n",
      "If the horsemen had already found the dell, the sooner Strider led them somewhere else the better\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam viewed the hollow with great dislike, now that he had heard news of their enemies on the Road, only a few miles away\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hadn’t we better clear out quick, Mr# Strider?’ he asked impatiently\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is getting late, and I don’t like this hole: it makes my heart sink somehow\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, we certainly must decide what to do at once,’ answered Strider, looking up and considering the time and the weather\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, Sam,’ he said at last, ‘I do not like this place either; but I cannot think of anywhere better that we could reach before nightfall\n",
      "\n",
      "At least we are out of sight for the moment, and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen by spies\n",
      "\n",
      "All we could do would be to go right out of our way back north on this side of the line of hills, where the land is all much the same as it is here\n",
      "\n",
      "The Road is watched, but we should have to cross it, if we tried to take cover in the thickets away to the south\n",
      "\n",
      "On the north side of the Road beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles\n",
      "\n",
      "Can the Riders see?’ asked Merry\n",
      "\n",

      "As the stars above the mists of the Northern lands was her loveliness, and in her face was a shining light\n",

      "Many sorrows befell them afterwards, and they were parted long\n",
      "\n",
      "Tinúviel rescued Beren from the dungeons of Sauron, and together they passed through great dangers, and cast down even the Great Enemy from his throne, and took from his iron crown one of the three Silmarils, brightest of all jewels, to be the bride-price of Lúthien to Thingol her father\n",

      "So it is that Lúthien Tinúviel alone of the Elf-kindred has died indeed and left the world, and they have lost her whom they most loved\n",

      "They started, and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo; but Strider knelt down swiftly at his side\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am not a Black Rider, Sam,’ he said gently, ‘nor in league with them\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been trying to discover something of their movements; but I have found nothing\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand\n",
      "\n",
      "’When he heard what Frodo had to tell, he became full of concern, and shook his head and sighed\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much water as they could in their small kettles, and to bathe the wound with it\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo warm!’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he got up and walked away, and called Sam to him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think I understand things better now,’ he said in a low voice\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There seem only to have been five of the enemy\n",
      "\n",
      "Why they were not all here, I don’t know; but I don’t think they expected to be resisted\n",
      "\n",
      "They have drawn off for the time being\n",
      "\n",
      "But not far, I fear\n",
      "\n",
      "They will come again another night, if we cannot escape\n",
      "\n",
      "They are only waiting, because they think that their purpose is almost accomplished, and that the Ring cannot fly much further\n",
      "\n",
      "I fear, Sam, that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to their will\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall see!’Sam choked with tears\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t despair!’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You must trust me now\n",
      "\n",
      "Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed, though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so\n",
      "\n",
      "He is not slain, and I think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect\n",
      "\n",
      "I will do all I can to help and heal him\n",
      "\n",
      "Guard him well, while I am away!’ He hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side\n",
      "\n",
      "His friends watched over him, warming him, and bathing his wound\n",
      "\n",
      "The night passed slowly and wearily\n",
      "\n",
      "Dawn was growing in the sky, and the dell was filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Look!’ he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that had lain there hidden by the darkness\n",
      "\n",
      "A foot above the lower hem there was a slash\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This was the stroke of Frodo’s sword,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The only hurt that it did to his enemy, I fear; for it is unharmed, but all blades perish that pierce that dreadful King\n",
      "\n",
      "More deadly to him was the name of Elbereth\n",
      "\n",
      "And more deadly to Frodo was this!’ He stooped again and lifted up a long thin knife\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a cold gleam in it\n",
      "\n",
      "As Strider raised it they saw that near the end its edge was notched and the point was broken off\n",
      "\n",
      "But even as he held it up in the growing light, they gazed in astonishment, for the blade seemed to melt, and vanished like a smoke in the air, leaving only the hilt in Strider’s hand\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Alas!’ he cried\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It was this accursed knife that gave the wound\n",
      "\n",
      "Few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons\n",
      "\n",
      "But I will do what I can\n",
      "\n",
      "’He sat down on the ground, and taking the dagger-hilt laid it on his knees, and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue\n",
      "\n",
      "Then setting it aside, he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch\n",
      "\n",
      "From the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a plant\n",
      "\n",
      "‘These leaves,’ he said, ‘I have walked far to find; for this plant does not grow in the bare hills; but in the thickets away south of the Road I found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He crushed a leaf in his fingers, and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is fortunate that I could find it, for it is a healing plant that the Men of the West brought to Middle-earth\n",
      "\n",
      "Athelas they named it, and it grows now sparsely and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old; and it is not known in the North, except to some of those who wander in the Wild\n",
      "\n",
      "It has great virtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small\n",
      "\n",
      "’He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo’s shoulder\n",
      "\n",
      "The fragrance of the steam was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their minds calmed and cleared\n",
      "\n",
      "The herb had also some power over the wound, for Frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side; but the life did not return to his arm, and he could not raise or use his hand\n",
      "\n",
      "He bitterly regretted his foolishness, and reproached himself for weakness of will; for he now perceived that in putting on the Ring he obeyed not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies\n",
      "\n",
      "He wondered if he would remain maimed for life, and how they would now manage to continue their journey\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt too weak to stand\n",
      "\n",
      "The others were discussing this very question\n",
      "\n",
      "They quickly decided to leave Weathertop as soon as possible\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think now,’ said Strider, ‘that the enemy has been watching this place for some days\n",
      "\n",
      "If Gandalf ever came here, then he must have been forced to ride away, and he will not return\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case we are in great peril here after dark, since the attack of last night, and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go\n",
      "\n",
      "’As soon as the daylight was full, they had some hurried food and packed\n",
      "\n",
      "It was impossible for Frodo to walk, so they divided the greater part of their baggage among the four of them, and put Frodo on the pony\n",
      "\n",
      "In the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed fatter and stronger, and had begun to show an affection for its new masters, especially for Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill Ferny’s treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life\n",
      "\n",
      "They started off in a southerly direction\n",
      "\n",
      "This would mean crossing the Road, but it was the quickest way to more wooded country\n",
      "\n",
      "And they needed fuel; for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm, especially at night, while fire would be some protection for them all\n",
      "\n",
      "It was also his plan to shorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the Road: east beyond Weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards\n",
      "\n",
      "They made their way slowly and cautiously round the south-western slopes of the hill, and came in a little while to the edge of the Road\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no sign of the Riders\n",
      "\n",
      "But even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two cries: a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering\n",
      "\n",
      "Trembling they sprang forward, and made for the thickets that lay ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "The land before them sloped away southwards, but it was wild and pathless; bushes and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in between\n",
      "\n",
      "The grass was scanty, coarse, and grey; and the leaves in the thickets were faded and falling\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a cheerless land, and their journey was slow and gloomy\n",
      "\n",
      "They spoke little as they trudged along\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo’s heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down, and their backs bowed under their burdens\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Strider seemed tired and heavy-hearted\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the first day’s march was over Frodo’s pain began to grow again, but he did not speak of it for a long time\n",
      "\n",
      "Four days passed, without the ground or the scene changing much, except that behind them Weathertop slowly sank, and before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked their flight or followed them\n",
      "\n",
      "They dreaded the dark hours, and kept watch in pairs by night, expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the grey night, dimly lit by the cloud-veiled moon; but they saw nothing, and heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass\n",
      "\n",
      "Not once did they feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in the dell\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed too much to hope that the Riders had already lost their trail again\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow place?At the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider now turned their course again north-eastwards, and on the sixth day they reached the top of a long slow-climbing slope, and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills\n",
      "\n",
      "Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round the feet of the hills; and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine\n",
      "\n",
      "In the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley half-veiled in mist\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am afraid we must go back to the Road here for a while,’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We have now come to the River Hoarwell, that the Elves call Mitheithel\n",
      "\n",
      "It flows down out of the Ettenmoors, the troll-fells north of Rivendell, and joins the Loudwater away in the South\n",
      "\n",
      "Some call it the Greyflood after that\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a great water before it finds the Sea\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no way over it below its sources in the Ettenmoors, except by the Last Bridge on which the Road crosses\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is that other river we can see far away there?’ asked Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is Loudwater, the Bruinen of Rivendell,’ answered Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the Bridge to the Ford of Bruinen\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have not yet thought how we shall cross that water\n",
      "\n",
      "One river at a time! We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the Last Bridge held against us\n",
      "\n",
      "’Next day, early in the morning, they came down again to the borders of the Road\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam and Strider went forward, but they found no sign of any travellers or riders\n",
      "\n",
      "Here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider judged that it had fallen two days before, and had washed away all footprints\n",
      "\n",
      "No horseman had passed since then, as far as he could see\n",
      "\n",
      "They hurried along with all the speed they could make, and after a mile or two they saw the Last Bridge ahead, at the bottom of a short steep slope\n",
      "\n",
      "They dreaded to see black figures waiting there, but they saw none\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the Road, while he went forward to explore\n",
      "\n",
      "Before long he came hurrying back\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can see no sign of the enemy,’ he said, ‘and I wonder very much what that means\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have found something very strange\n",
      "\n",
      "’He held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I found it in the mud in the middle of the Bridge,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is a beryl, an elf-stone\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it was set there, or let fall by chance, I cannot say; but it brings hope to me\n",
      "\n",
      "I will take it as a sign that we may pass the Bridge; but beyond that I dare not keep to the Road, without some clearer token\n",
      "\n",
      "’At once they went on again\n",
      "\n",
      "They crossed the Bridge in safety, hearing no sound but the water swirling against its three great arches\n",
      "\n",
      "A mile further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the Road\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Strider turned aside, and soon they were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen hills\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous Road behind them; but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly\n",
      "\n",
      "As they went forward the hills about them steadily rose\n",
      "\n",
      "Here and there upon heights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone, and the ruins of towers: they had an ominous look\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo, who was not walking, had time to gaze ahead and to think\n",
      "\n",
      "He recalled Bilbo’s account of his journey and the threatening towers on the hills north of the Road, in the country near the Trolls’ wood where his first serious adventure had happened\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo guessed that they were now in the same region, and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who lives in this land?’ he asked\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And who built these towers? Is this troll-country?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No!’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Trolls do not build\n",
      "\n",
      "No one lives in this land\n",
      "\n",
      "Men once dwelt here, ages ago; but none remain now\n",
      "\n",
      "They became an evil people, as legends tell, for they fell under the shadow of Angmar\n",
      "\n",
      "But all were destroyed in the war that brought the North Kingdom to its end\n",
      "\n",
      "But that is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them, though a shadow still lies on the land\n",
      "\n",
      "Where did you learn such tales, if all the land is empty and forgetful?’ asked Peregrin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The birds and beasts do not tell tales of that sort\n",
      "\n",
      "The heirs of Elendil do not forget all things past,’ said Strider; ‘and many more things than I can tell are remembered in Rivendell\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you often been to Rivendell?’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have,’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I dwelt there once, and still I return when I may\n",
      "\n",
      "There my heart is; but it is not my fate to sit in peace, even in the fair house of Elrond\n",
      "\n",
      "’The hills now began to shut them in\n",
      "\n",
      "The Road behind held on its way to the River Bruinen, but both were now hidden from view\n",
      "\n",
      "The travellers came into a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark and silent\n",
      "\n",
      "Trees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs, and piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine-wood\n",
      "\n",
      "The hobbits grew very weary\n",
      "\n",
      "They advanced slowly, for they had to pick their way through a pathless country, encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as they could they avoided climbing for Frodo’s sake, and because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales\n",
      "\n",
      "They had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind began to blow steadily out of the West and pour the water of the distant seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain\n",
      "\n",
      "By nightfall they were all soaked, and their camp was cheerless, for they could not get any fire to burn\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day the hills rose still higher and steeper before them, and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their course\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider seemed to be getting anxious: they were nearly ten days out from Weathertop, and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low\n",
      "\n",
      "It went on raining\n",
      "\n",
      "That night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock-wall behind them, in which there was a shallow cave, a mere scoop in the cliff\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo was restless\n",
      "\n",
      "The cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever, and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "He lay tossing and turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night-noises: wind in chinks of rock, water dripping, a crack, the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him; but when he sat up he saw nothing but the back of Strider sitting hunched up, smoking his pipe, and watching\n",
      "\n",
      "He lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream, in which he walked on the grass in his garden in theShire, but it seemed faint and dim, less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedge\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped\n",
      "\n",
      "The clouds were still thick, but they were breaking, and pale strips of blue appeared between them\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind was shifting again\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not start early\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast Strider went off alone, telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff, until he came back\n",
      "\n",
      "He was going to climb up, if he could, and get a look at the lie of the land\n",
      "\n",
      "When he returned he was not reassuring\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We have come too far to the north,’ he said, ‘and we must find some way to turn back southwards again\n",
      "\n",
      "If we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the Ettendales far north of Rivendell\n",
      "\n",
      "That is troll-country, and little known to me\n",
      "\n",
      "We could perhaps find our way through and come round to Rivendell from the north; but it would take too long, for I do not know the way, and our food would not last\n",
      "\n",
      "So somehow or other we must find the Ford of Bruinen\n",
      "\n",
      "’The rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground\n",
      "\n",
      "They found a passage between two hills that led them into a valley running south-east, the direction that they wished to take; but towards the end of the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land; its dark edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a blunted saw\n",
      "\n",
      "They had a choice between going back or climbing over it\n",
      "\n",
      "They decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very difficult\n",
      "\n",
      "Before long Frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so they often despaired of getting their pony up, or indeed of finding a path for themselves, burdened as they were\n",
      "\n",
      "The light was nearly gone, and they were all exhausted, when at last they reached the top\n",
      "\n",
      "They had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two higher points, and the land fell steeply away again, only a short distance ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo threw himself down, and lay on the ground shivering\n",
      "\n",
      "His left arm was lifeless, and his side and shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid upon them\n",
      "\n",
      "The trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dim\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We cannot go any further,’ said Merry to Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am afraid this has been too much for Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "I am dreadfully anxious about him\n",
      "\n",
      "What are we to do? Do you think they will be able to cure him in Rivendell, if we ever get there?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We shall see,’ answered Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There is nothing more that I can do in the wilderness; and it is chiefly because of his wound that I am so anxious to press on\n",
      "\n",
      "But I agree that we can go no further tonight\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the matter with my master?’ asked Sam in a low voice, looking appealingly at Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘His wound was small, and it is already closed\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,’ said Strider, ‘and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive out\n",
      "\n",
      "But do not give up hope, Sam!’Night was cold up on the high ridge\n",
      "\n",
      "They lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots of an old pine, that hung over a shallow pit: it looked as if stone had once been quarried there\n",
      "\n",
      "They sat huddled together\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind blew chill through the pass, and they heard the tree-tops lower down moaning and sighing\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo lay half in a dream, imagining that endless dark wings were sweeping by above him, and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of the hills\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning dawned bright and fair; the air was clean, and the light pale and clear in a rain-washed sky\n",
      "\n",
      "Their hearts were encouraged, but they longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as it was light, Strider took Merry with him and went to survey the country from the height to the east of the pass\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun had risen and was shining brightly when he returned with more comforting news\n",
      "\n",
      "They were now going more or less in the right direction\n",
      "\n",
      "If they went on, down the further side of the ridge, they would have the Mountains on their left\n",
      "\n",
      "Some way ahead Strider had caught a glimpse of the Loudwater again, and he knew that, though it was hidden from view, the Road to the Ford was not far from the River and lay on the side nearest to them\n",
      "\n",

      "’As soon as they had eaten they set out again\n",
      "\n",
      "They climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge; but the way was much easier than they had expected, for the slope was far less steep on this side, and before long Frodo was able to ride again\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill Ferny’s poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path, and for sparing its rider as many jolts as possible\n",
      "\n",
      "The spirits of the party rose again\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Frodo felt better in the morning light, but every now and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight, and he passed his hands over his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin was a little ahead of the others\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he turned round and called to them\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There is a path here!’ he cried\n",
      "\n",
      "When they came up with him, they saw that he had made no mistake: there were clearly the beginnings of a path, that climbed with many windings out of the woods below and faded away on the hill-top behind\n",
      "\n",
      "In places it was now faint and overgrown, or choked with fallen stones and trees; but at one time it seemed to have been much used\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet\n",
      "\n",
      "Here and there old trees had been cut or broken down, and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way\n",
      "\n",
      "They followed the track for some while, for it offered much the easiest way down, but they went cautiously, and their anxiety increased as they came into the dark woods, and the path grew plainer and broader\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly coming out of a belt of fir-trees it ran steeply down a slope, and turned sharply to the left round the corner of a rocky shoulder of the hill\n",
      "\n",
      "When they came to the corner they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level strip under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees\n",
      "\n",
      "In the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside the door they all halted\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a cave or rock-chamber behind, but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider, Sam, and Merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little wider, and then Strider and Merry went in\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not go far, for on the floor lay many old bones, and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken pots\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Surely this is a troll-hole, if ever there was one!’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come out, you two, and let us get away\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we know who made the path – and we had better get off it quick\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no need, I think,’ said Strider, coming out\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is certainly a troll-hole, but it seems to have been long forsaken\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t think we need be afraid\n",
      "\n",
      "But let us go on down warily, and we shall see\n",
      "\n",
      "’The path went on again from the door, and turning to the right again across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin, not liking to show Strider that he was still afraid, went on ahead with Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam and Strider came behind, one on each side of Frodo’s pony, for the path was now broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast\n",
      "\n",
      "But they had not gone very far before Pippin came running back, followed by Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "They both looked terrified\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There are trolls!’ Pippin panted\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Down in a clearing in the woods not far below\n",
      "\n",
      "We got a sight of them through the tree-trunks\n",
      "\n",
      "They are very large!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We will come and look at them,’ said Strider, picking up a stick\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo said nothing, but Sam looked scared\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was now high, and it shone down through the half-stripped branches of the trees, and lit the clearing with bright patches of light\n",
      "\n",
      "They halted suddenly on the edge, and peered through the tree-trunks, holding their breath\n",
      "\n",
      "There stood the trolls: three large trolls\n",
      "\n",
      "One was stooping, and the other two stood staring at him\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider walked forward unconcernedly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Get up, old stone!’ he said, and broke his stick upon the stooping troll\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing happened\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits, and then even Frodo laughed\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well!’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We are forgetting our family history! These must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf, quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I had no idea we were anywhere near the place!’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew the story well\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo and Frodo had told it often; but as a matter of fact he had never more than half believed it\n",
      "\n",
      "Even now he looked at the stone trolls with suspicion, wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them to life again\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever knew about trolls,’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is broad daylight with a bright sun, and yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for us in this glade! In any case you might have noticed that one of them has an old bird’s nest behind his ear\n",
      "\n",
      "That would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll!’They all laughed\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo felt his spirits reviving: the reminder of Bilbo’s first successful adventure was heartening\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun, too, was warm and comforting, and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little\n",
      "\n",
      "They rested for some time in the glade, and took their mid-day meal right under the shadow of the trolls’ large legs\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Won’t somebody give us a bit of a song, while the sun is high?’ said Merry, when they had finished\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We haven’t had a song or a tale for days\n",
      "\n",
      "Not since Weathertop,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "The others looked at him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t worry about me!’ he added\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I feel much better, but I don’t think I could sing\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps Sam could dig something out of his memory\n",
      "\n",
      "Come on, Sam!’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s more stored in your head than you let on about\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t know about that,’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But how would this suit? It ain’t what I call proper poetry, if you understand me: just a bit of nonsense\n",
      "\n",
      "But these old images here brought it to my mind\n",
      "\n",
      "’ Standing up, with his hands behind his back, as if he was at school, he began to sing to an old tune\n",
      "\n",
      "Troll sat alone on his seat of stone,\n",
      "\n",
      "And munched and mumbled a bare old bone;\n",
      "\n",
      "For many a year he had gnawed it near,\n",
      "\n",
      "For meat was hard to come by\n",

      "Done by! Gum by!\n",

      "Caveyard! Paveyard!\n",

      "\n",
      "A bump o’ the boot on the seat, Tom thought,\n",

      "‘I don’t want to be neither!’In the afternoon they went on down the woods\n",
      "\n",
      "They were probably following the very track that Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves had used many years before\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few miles they came out on the top of a high bank above the Road\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point the Road had left the Hoarwell far behind in its narrow valley, and now clung close to the feet of the hills, rolling and winding eastward among woods and heather-covered slopes towards the Ford and the Mountains\n",
      "\n",
      "Not far down the bank Strider pointed out a stone in the grass\n",
      "\n",
      "On it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen dwarf-runes and secret marks\n",

      "‘That must be the stone that marked the place where the trolls’ gold was hidden\n",
      "\n",
      "How much is left of Bilbo’s share, I wonder, Frodo?’Frodo looked at the stone, and wished that Bilbo had brought home no treasure more perilous, nor less easy to part with\n",
      "\n",
      "‘None at all,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Bilbo gave it all away\n",

      "\n",
      "There was no sign of any other travellers to be seen\n",

      "As there was now no other possible course for them to take, they climbed down the bank, and turning left went off as fast as they could\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light of the fast westering sun\n",
      "\n",
      "A cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "They were beginning to look out for a place off the Road, where they could camp for the night, when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into their hearts: the noise of hoofs behind them\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked back, but they could not see far because of the many windings and rollings of the Road\n",
      "\n",
      "As quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above, until they came to a small patch of thick-growing hazels\n",
      "\n",
      "As they peered out from among the bushes, they could see the Road, faint and grey in the failing light, some thirty feet below them\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of hoofs drew nearer\n",
      "\n",
      "They were going fast, with a light clippety-clippety-clip\n",
      "\n",
      "Then faintly, as if it was blown away from them by the breeze, they seemed to catch a dim ringing, as of small bells tinkling\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That does not sound like a Black Rider’s horse!’ said Frodo, listening intently\n",
      "\n",
      "The other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not, but they all remained full of suspicion\n",
      "\n",
      "They had been in fear of pursuit for so long that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly\n",
      "\n",
      "But Strider was now leaning forward, stooped to the ground, with a hand to his ear, and a look of joy on his face\n",
      "\n",
      "The light faded, and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearer and nearer now the bells jingled, and clippety-clip came the quick trotting feet\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows, running swiftly\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed, as if it were studded with gems like living stars\n",
      "\n",
      "The rider’s cloak streamed behind him, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed\n",
      "\n",
      "To Frodo it appeared that a white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider, as if through a thin veil\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the Road, leaping with a cry through the heather; but even before he had moved or called, the rider had reined in his horse and halted, looking up towards the thicket where they stood\n",
      "\n",
      "When he saw Strider, he dismounted and ran to meet him calling out: Ai na vedui Dúnadan! Mae govannen! His speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their hearts: the rider was of the Elven-folk\n",
      "\n",
      "No others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear\n",
      "\n",
      "But there seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call, and they saw that he was now speaking quickly and urgently to Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon Strider beckoned to them, and the hobbits left the bushes and hurried down to the Road\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is Glorfindel, who dwells in the house of Elrond,’ said Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hail, and well met at last!’ said the Elf-lord to Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I was sent from Rivendell to look for you\n",
      "\n",
      "We feared that you were in danger upon the road\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?’ cried Frodo joyfully\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not when I departed; but that was nine days ago,’ answered Glorfindel\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Elrond received news that troubled him\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of my kindred, journeying in your land beyond the Baranduin, * learned that things were amiss, and sent messages as swiftly as they could\n",
      "\n",
      "They said that the Nine were abroad, and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance, for Gandalf had not returned\n",
      "\n",
      "There are few even in Rivendell that can ride openly against the Nine; but such as there were, Elrond sent out north, west, and south\n",
      "\n",
      "It was thought that you might turn far aside to avoid pursuit, and become lost in the Wilderness\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It was my lot to take the Road, and I came to the Bridge of Mitheithel, and left a token there, nigh on seven days ago\n",
      "\n",
      "Three of the servants of Sauron were upon the Bridge, but they withdrew and I pursued them westward\n",
      "\n",
      "I came also upon two others, but they turned away southward\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then I have searched for your trail\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days ago I found it, and followed it over the Bridge; and today I marked where you descended from the hills again\n",
      "\n",
      "But come! There is no time for further news\n",
      "\n",
      "Since you are here we must risk the peril of the Road and go\n",
      "\n",
      "There are five behind us, and when they find your trail upon the Road they will ride after us like the wind\n",
      "\n",
      "And they are not all\n",
      "\n",
      "Where the other four may be, I do not know\n",

      "’While Glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo felt a great weariness come over him\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since the sun began to sink the mist before his eyes had darkened, and he felt that a shadow was coming between him and the faces of his friends\n",
      "\n",
      "Now pain assailed him, and he felt cold\n",
      "\n",
      "He swayed, clutching at Sam’s arm\n",

      "His hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of his sword, and with a red flash he drew it\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ride on! Ride on!’ cried Glorfindel, and then loud and clear he called to the horse in the elf-tongue: noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!At once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the Road\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same moment the black horses leaped down the hill in pursuit, and from the Riders came a terrible cry, such as Frodo had heard filling the woods with horror in the Eastfarthing far away\n",

      "There seemed no chance of reaching the Ford before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush\n",

      "\n",
      "A breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear, as with a last spurt, like a flash of white fire, the elf-horse speeding as if on wings, passed right before the face of the foremost Rider\n",

      "There were Nine Riders at the water’s edge below, and Frodo’s spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifted faces\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as easily as he had done; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over the long uncertain path from the Ford to the edge of Rivendell, if once the Riders crossed\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt\n",
      "\n",
      "Hatred again stirred in him, but he had no longer the strength to refuse\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the foremost Rider spurred his horse forward\n",
      "\n",
      "It checked at the water and reared up\n",

      "‘Go back!’ he cried\n",

      "\n",
      "His enemies laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughter\n",

      "\n",
      "‘By Elbereth and Lúthien the Fair,’ said Frodo with a last effort, lifting up his sword, ‘you shall have neither the Ring nor me!’Then the leader, who was now half across the Ford, stood up menacing in his stirrups, and raised up his hand\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo was stricken dumb\n",
      "\n",

      "Dimly Frodo saw the river below him rise, and down along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves\n",
      "\n",
      "White flames seemed to Frodo to flicker on their crests, and he half fancied that he saw amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes\n",
      "\n",
      "The three Riders that were still in the midst of the Ford were overwhelmed: they disappeared, buried suddenly under angry foam\n",
      "\n",
      "Those that were behind drew back in dismay\n",
      "\n",
      "With his last failing senses Frodo heard cries, and it seemed to him that he saw, beyond the Riders that hesitated on the shore, a shining figure of white light; and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames, that flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world\n",
      "\n",
      "The black horses were filled with madness, and leaping forward in terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood\n",
      "\n",
      "Their piercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried them away\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Frodo felt himself falling, and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and engulf him together with his enemies\n",

      "\n",
      "I thought he was only a Ranger\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a Ranger!’ cried Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My dear Frodo, that is just what the Rangers are: the last remnant in the North of the great people, the Men of the West\n",
      "\n",
      "They have helped me before; and I shall need their help in the days to come; for we have reached Rivendell, but the Ring is not yet at rest\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose not,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But so far my only thought has been to get here; and I hope I shan’t have to go any further\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very pleasant just to rest\n",
      "\n",

      "’He fell silent and shut his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while he spoke again\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have been reckoning,’ he said, ‘and I can’t bring the total up to October the twenty-fourth\n",
      "\n",
      "It ought to be the twenty-first\n",
      "\n",
      "We must have reached the Ford by the twentieth\n",
      "\n",
      "You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How do the side and shoulder feel now?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know,’ Frodo answered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They don’t feel at all: which is an improvement, but’ – he made an effort – ‘I can move my arm again a little\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it is coming back to life\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not cold,’ he added, touching his left hand with his right\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Good!’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is mending fast\n",
      "\n",
      "You will soon be sound again\n",
      "\n",
      "Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since you were brought in\n",
      "\n",
      "Days?’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, four nights and three days, to be exact\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elves brought you from the Ford on the night of the twentieth, and that is where you lost count\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been terribly anxious, and Sam has hardly left your side, day or night, except to run messages\n",
      "\n",
      "Elrond is a master of healing, but the weapons of our Enemy are deadly\n",
      "\n",
      "To tell you the truth, I had very little hope; for I suspected that there was some fragment of the blade still in the closed wound\n",
      "\n",
      "But it could not be found until last night\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Elrond removed a splinter\n",
      "\n",
      "It was deeply buried, and it was working inwards\n",
      "\n",
      "’Frodo shuddered, remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that had vanished in Strider’s hands\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t be alarmed!’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is gone now\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been melted\n",
      "\n",
      "And it seems that Hobbits fade very reluctantly\n",
      "\n",
      "I have known strong warriors of the Big People who would quickly have been overcome by that splinter, which you bore for seventeen days\n",
      "\n",
      "What would they have done to me?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What were the Riders trying to do?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They tried to pierce your heart with a Morgul-knife which remains in the wound\n",
      "\n",
      "If they had succeeded, you would have become like they are, only weaker and under their command\n",
      "\n",
      "You would have become a wraith under the dominion of the Dark Lord; and he would have tormented you for trying to keep his Ring, if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his hand\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank goodness I did not realize the horrible danger!’ said Frodo faintly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I was mortally afraid, of course; but if I had known more, I should not have dared even to move\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a marvel that I escaped!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,’ said Gandalf, ‘not to mention courage\n",
      "\n",
      "For your heart was not touched, and only your shoulder was pierced; and that was because you resisted to the last\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was a terribly narrow shave, so to speak\n",
      "\n",
      "You were in gravest peril while you wore the Ring, for then you were half in the wraith-world yourself, and they might have seized you\n",
      "\n",
      "You could see them, and they could see you\n",
      "\n",
      "I know,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They were terrible to behold! But why could we all see their horses?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Because they are real horses; just as the black robes are real robes that they wear to give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings with the living\n",
      "\n",
      "Then why do these black horses endure such riders? All other animals are terrified when they draw near, even the elf-horse of Glorfindel\n",
      "\n",
      "The dogs howl and the geese scream at them\n",
      "\n",
      "Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark Lord in Mordor\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all his servants and chattels are wraiths! There are orcs and trolls, there are wargs and werewolves; and there have been and still are many Men, warriors and kings, that walk alive under the Sun, and yet are under his sway\n",
      "\n",
      "And their number is growing daily\n",
      "\n",
      "What about Rivendell and the Elves? Is Rivendell safe?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, at present, until all else is conquered\n",
      "\n",
      "The Elves may fear the Dark Lord, and they may fly before him, but never again will they listen to him or serve him\n",
      "\n",
      "And here in Rivendell there live still some of his chief foes: the Elven-wise, lords of the Eldar from beyond the furthest seas\n",
      "\n",
      "They do not fear the Ringwraiths, for those who have dwelt in the Blessed Realm live at once in both worlds, and against both the Seen and the Unseen they have great power\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought that I saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim like the others\n",
      "\n",
      "Was that Glorfindel then?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side: one of the mighty of the Firstborn\n",
      "\n",
      "He is an Elf-lord of a house of princes\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed there is a power in Rivendell to withstand the might of Mordor, for a while: and elsewhere other powers still dwell\n",
      "\n",
      "There is power, too, of another kind in the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "But all such places will soon become islands under siege, if things go on as they are going\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dark Lord is putting forth all his strength\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Still,’ he said, standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin, while his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire, ‘we must keep up our courage\n",
      "\n",
      "You will soon be well, if I do not talk you to death\n",
      "\n",
      "You are in Rivendell, and you need not worry about anything for the present\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven’t any courage to keep up,’ said Frodo, ‘but I am not worried at the moment\n",
      "\n",
      "Just give me news of my friends, and tell me the end of the affair at the Ford, as I keep on asking, and I shall be content for the present\n",
      "\n",
      "After that I shall have another sleep, I think; but I shan’t be able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf moved his chair to the bedside and took a good look at Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "The colour had come back to his face, and his eyes were clear, and fully awake and aware\n",
      "\n",
      "He was smiling, and there seemed to be little wrong with him\n",
      "\n",
      "But to the wizard’s eye there was a faint change, just a hint as it were of transparency, about him, and especially about the left hand that lay outside upon the coverlet\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Still that must be expected,’ said Gandalf to himself\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He is not half through yet, and to what he will come in the end not even Elrond can foretell\n",
      "\n",
      "Not to evil, I think\n",
      "\n",
      "He may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can\n",
      "\n",
      "You look splendid,’ he said aloud\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will risk a brief tale without consulting Elrond\n",
      "\n",
      "But quite brief, mind you, and then you must sleep again\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what happened, as far as I can gather\n",
      "\n",
      "The Riders made straight for you, as soon as you fled\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not need the guidance of their horses any longer: you had become visible to them, being already on the threshold of their world\n",
      "\n",
      "And also the Ring drew them\n",
      "\n",
      "Your friends sprang aside, off the road, or they would have been ridden down\n",
      "\n",
      "They knew that nothing could save you, if the white horse could not\n",
      "\n",
      "The Riders were too swift to overtake, and too many to oppose\n",
      "\n",
      "On foot even Glorfindel and Aragorn together could not withstand all the Nine at once\n",
      "\n",
      "‘When the Ringwraiths swept by, your friends ran up behind\n",
      "\n",
      "Close to the Ford there is a small hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted trees\n",
      "\n",
      "There they hastily kindled fire; for Glorfindel knew that a flood would come down, if the Riders tried to cross, and then he would have to deal with any that were left on his side of the river\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment the flood appeared, he rushed out, followed by Aragorn and the others with flaming brands\n",
      "\n",
      "Caught between fire and water, and seeing an Elf-lord revealed in his wrath, they were dismayed, and their horses were stricken with madness\n",
      "\n",
      "Three were carried away by the first assault of the flood; the others were now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed\n",
      "\n",
      "And is that the end of the Black Riders?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Their horses must have perished, and without them they are crippled\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is nothing more to fear from them at present\n",
      "\n",
      "Your friends crossed after the flood had passed and they found you lying on your face at the top of the bank, with a broken sword under you\n",
      "\n",
      "The horse was standing guard beside you\n",
      "\n",
      "You were pale and cold, and they feared that you were dead, or worse\n",
      "\n",
      "Elrond’s folk met them, carrying you slowly towards Rivendell\n",
      "\n",
      "Who made the flood?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Elrond commanded it,’ answered Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The river of this valley is under his power, and it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the Ford\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the captain of the Ringwraiths rode into the water the flood was released\n",
      "\n",
      "If I may say so, I added a few touches of my own: you may not have noticed, but some of the waves took the form of great white horses with shining white riders; and there were many rolling and grinding boulders\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment I was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a wrath, and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away\n",
      "\n",
      "There is great vigour in the waters that come down from the snows of the Misty Mountains\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it all comes back to me now,’ said Frodo: ‘the tremendous roaring\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I was drowning, with my friends and enemies and all\n",
      "\n",
      "But now we are safe!’Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo, but he had shut his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, you are all safe for the present\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate the victory at the Ford of Bruinen, and you will all be there in places of honour\n",
      "\n",
      "Splendid!’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is wonderful that Elrond, and Glorfindel and such great lords, not to mention Strider, should take so much trouble and show me so much kindness\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, there are many reasons why they should,’ said Gandalf, smiling\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am one good reason\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring is another: you are the Ring-bearer\n",
      "\n",
      "And you are the heir of Bilbo, the Ring-finder\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear Bilbo!’ said Frodo sleepily\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wonder where he is\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish he was here and could hear all about it\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have made him laugh\n",
      "\n",
      "The cow jumped over the Moon! And the poor old troll!’ With that he fell fast asleep\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo was now safe in the Last Homely House east of the Sea\n",
      "\n",
      "That house was, as Bilbo had long ago reported, ‘a perfect house, whether you like food or sleep or story-telling or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all’\n",
      "\n",
      "Merely to be there was a cure for weariness, fear, and sadness\n",
      "\n",
      "As the evening drew on, Frodo woke up again, and he found that he no longer felt in need of rest or sleep, but had a mind for food and drink, and probably for singing and story-telling afterwards\n",
      "\n",
      "He got out of bed and discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had been\n",
      "\n",
      "He found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him excellently\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking in a mirror he was startled to see a much thinner reflection of himself than he remembered: it looked remarkably like the young nephew of Bilbo who used to go tramping with his uncle in the Shire; but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a looking-glass,’ he said to his reflection\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But now for a merry meeting!’ He stretched out his arms and whistled a tune\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment there was a knock on the door, and Sam came in\n",
      "\n",
      "He ran to Frodo and took his left hand, awkwardly and shyly\n",
      "\n",
      "He stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hullo, Sam!’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s warm!’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Meaning your hand, Mr# Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "It has felt so cold through the long nights\n",
      "\n",
      "But glory and trumpets!’ he cried, turning round again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s fine to see you up and yourself again, sir! Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were ready to come down, and I thought he was joking\n",
      "\n",
      "I am ready,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Let’s go and look for the rest of the party!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can take you to them, sir,’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s a big house this, and very peculiar\n",
      "\n",
      "Always a bit more to discover, and no knowing what you’ll find round a corner\n",
      "\n",
      "And Elves, sir! Elves here, and Elves there! Some like kings, terrible and splendid; and some as merry as children\n",
      "\n",
      "And the music and the singing – not that I have had the time or the heart for much listening since we got here\n",
      "\n",
      "But I’m getting to know some of the ways of the place\n",
      "\n",
      "I know what you have been doing, Sam,’ said Frodo, taking his arm\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But you shall be merry tonight, and listen to your heart’s content\n",
      "\n",
      "Come on, guide me round the corners!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a high garden above the steep bank of the river\n",
      "\n",
      "He found his friends sitting in a porch on the side of the house looking east\n",
      "\n",
      "Shadows had fallen in the valley below, but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far above\n",
      "\n",
      "The air was warm\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of running and falling water was loud, and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers, as if summer still lingered in Elrond’s gardens\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hurray!’ cried Pippin, springing up\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Here is our noble cousin! Make way for Frodo, Lord of the Ring!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hush!’ said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Evil things do not come into this valley; but all the same we should not name them\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the master of the Dark Tower of Mordor, whose power is again stretching out over the world\n",
      "\n",
      "We are sitting in a fortress\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside it is getting dark\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He thinks I need keeping in order\n",
      "\n",
      "But it seems impossible, somehow, to feel gloomy or depressed in this place\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel I could sing, if I knew the right song for the occasion\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like singing myself,’ laughed Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Though at the moment I feel more like eating and drinking\n",
      "\n",
      "That will soon be cured,’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You have shown your usual cunning in getting up just in time for a meal\n",
      "\n",
      "More than a meal! A feast!’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘As soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered, the preparations began\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells\n",
      "\n",
      "The hall of Elrond’s house was filled with folk: Elves for the most part, though there were a few guests of other sorts\n",
      "\n",
      "Elrond, as was his custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo looked at them in wonder; for he had never before seen Elrond, of whom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left, Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were revealed as lords of dignity and power\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend\n",
      "\n",
      "In his aged face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire\n",
      "\n",
      "Glorfindel was tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy; his eyes were bright and keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and in his hand was strength\n",
      "\n",
      "The face of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful\n",
      "\n",
      "His hair was dark as the shadows of twilight, and upon it was set a circlet of silver; his eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength\n",
      "\n",
      "He was the Lord of Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, there was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon, and so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that she was one of his close kindred\n",
      "\n",
      "Young she was and yet not so\n",
      "\n",
      "The braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost; her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth, and the light of stars was in her bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge were in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years bring\n",
      "\n",
      "Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver\n",
      "\n",
      "So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of Lúthien had come on earth again; and she was called Undómiel, for she was the Evenstar of her people\n",
      "\n",
      "Long she had been in the land of her mother’s kin, in Lórien beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her father’s house\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Such loveliness in living thing Frodo had never seen before nor imagined in his mind; and he was both surprised and abashed to find that he had a seat at Elrond’s table among all these folk so high and fair\n",
      "\n",
      "Though he had a suitable chair, and was raised upon several cushions, he felt very small, and rather out of place; but that feeling quickly passed\n",

      "\n",

      "Nothing like it has happened since Bilbo came with us\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,’ said Frodo politely\n",
      "\n",
      "He guessed that even in Elrond’s house the matter of the Ring was not one for casual talk; and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I am equally curious,’ he added, ‘to learn what brings so important a dwarf so far from the Lonely Mountain\n",

      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "Glóin looked at him\n",

      "\n",
      "Master Elrond will summon us all ere long, I believe, and then we shall all hear many things\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is much else that may be told\n",
      "\n",
      "’Throughout the rest of the meal they talked together, but Frodo listened more than he spoke; for the news of the Shire, apart from the Ring, seemed small and far-away and unimportant, while Glóin had much to tell of events in the northern regions of Wilderland\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo learned that Grimbeorn the Old, son of Beorn, was now the lord of many sturdy men, and to their land between the Mountains and Mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Indeed,’ said Glóin, ‘if it were not for the Beornings, the passage from Dale to Rivendell would long ago have become impossible\n",
      "\n",
      "They are valiant men and keep open the High Pass and the Ford of Carrock\n",
      "\n",
      "But their tolls are high,’ he added with a shake of his head; ‘and like Beorn of old they are not over fond of dwarves\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, they are trusty, and that is much in these days\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the Men of Dale\n",
      "\n",
      "They are good folk, the Bardings\n",
      "\n",
      "The grandson of Bard the Bowman rules them, Brand son of Bain son of Bard\n",
      "\n",
      "He is a strong king, and his realm now reaches far south and east of Esgaroth\n",
      "\n",
      "And what of your own people?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There is much to tell, good and bad,’ said Glóin; ‘yet it is mostly good: we have so far been fortunate, though we do not escape the shadow of these times\n",
      "\n",
      "If you really wish to hear of us, I will tell you tidings gladly\n",
      "\n",
      "But stop me when you are weary! Dwarves’ tongues run on when speaking of their handiwork, they say\n",
      "\n",
      "’And with that Glóin embarked on a long account of the doings of the Dwarf-kingdom\n",
      "\n",
      "He was delighted to have found so polite a listener; for Frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject, though actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of people and places that he had never heard of before\n",
      "\n",
      "He was interested, however, to hear that Dáin was still King under the Mountain, and was now old (having passed his two hundred and fiftieth year), venerable, and fabulously rich\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the ten companions who had survived the Battle of Five Armies seven were still with him: Dwalin, Glóin, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur\n",
      "\n",
      "Bombur was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at table, and it took six young dwarves to lift him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And what has become of Balin and Ori and Óin?’asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "A shadow passed over Glóin’s face\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We do not know,’ he answered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is largely on account of Balin that I have come to ask the advice of those that dwell in Rivendell\n",
      "\n",
      "But tonight let us speak of merrier things!’Glóin began then to talk of the works of his people, telling Frodo about their great labours in Dale and under the Mountain\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We have done well,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But in metal-work we cannot rival our fathers, many of whose secrets are lost\n",
      "\n",
      "We make good armour and keen swords, but we cannot again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon came\n",
      "\n",
      "Only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days\n",
      "\n",
      "You should see the waterways of Dale, Frodo, and the fountains, and the pools! You should see the stone-paved roads of many colours! And the halls and cavernous streets under the earth with arches carved like trees; and the terraces and towers upon the Mountain’s sides! Then you would see that we have not been idle\n",
      "\n",
      "I will come and see them, if ever I can,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How surprised Bilbo would have been to see all the changes in the Desolation of Smaug!’Glóin looked at Frodo and smiled\n",
      "\n",

      "Elrond and Arwen rose and went down the hall, and the company followed them in due order\n",
      "\n",
      "The doors were thrown open, and they went across a wide passage and through other doors, and came into a further hall\n",
      "\n",
      "In it were no tables, but a bright fire was burning in a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is the Hall of Fire,’ said the wizard\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Here you will hear many songs and tales – if you can keep awake\n",
      "\n",
      "But except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet, and people come here who wish for peace, and thought\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "’As Elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him, Elvish minstrels began to make sweet music\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly the hall filled, and Frodo looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together; the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he noticed, not far from the further end of the fire, a small dark figure seated on a stool with his back propped against a pillar\n",
      "\n",
      "Beside him on the ground was a drinking-cup and some bread\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo wondered whether he was ill (if people were ever ill in Rivendell), and had been unable to come to the feast\n",
      "\n",
      "His head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast, and a fold of his dark cloak was drawn over his face\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Awake, little master!’ he said, with a smile\n",

      "‘Now at last the hour has come that you have wished for, Frodo,’ he said\n",

      "\n",
      "’The dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face\n",

      "‘Bilbo!’ cried Frodo with sudden recognition, and he sprang forward\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hullo, Frodo my lad!’ said Bilbo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So you have got here at last\n",

      "\n",
      "Wake up, indeed!’ he said, cocking an eye at Elrond\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a bright twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness that Frodo could see\n",

      "If you want to know, you have all come out from your feast too soon, and you have disturbed me – in the middle of making up a song\n",

      "’ Messengers were sent to find Bilbo’s friend, though none knew where he was, or why he had not been present at the feast\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came quickly and placed himself near them\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked together in soft voices, oblivious of the mirth and music in the hall about them\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilbo had not much to say of himself\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had left Hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly, along the Road or in the country on either side; but somehow he had steered all the time towards Rivendell\n",

      "They sing them occasionally: just to please me, I think; for, of course, they aren’t really good enough for Rivendell\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Time doesn’t seem to pass here: it just is\n",

      "A remarkable place altogether\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hear all kinds of news, from over the Mountains, and out of the South, but hardly anything from the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard about the Ring, of course\n",
      "\n",

      "I have thought several times of going back to Hobbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they would not let me:Gandalf and Elrond, I mean\n",

      "They seemed to think that the Enemy was looking high and low for me, and would make mincemeat of me, if he caught me tottering about in the Wild\n",
      "\n",

      "He felt a desire to strike him\n",
      "\n",
      "The music and singing round them seemed to falter, and a silence fell\n",

      "At last, however, Balin listened to the whispers, and resolved to go; and though Dáin did not give leave willingly, he took with him Ori and Óinand many of our folk, and they went away south\n",

      "A part of his tale was known to some there, but the full tale to none, and many eyes were turned to Elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the Elven-smiths of Eregion and their friendship with Moria, and their eagerness for knowledge, by which Sauron ensnared them\n",
      "\n",
      "For in that time he was not yet evil to behold, and they received his aid and grew mighty in craft, whereas he learned all their secrets, and betrayed them, and forged secretly in the Mountain of Fire the One Ring to be their master\n",

      "But Celebrimbor was aware of him, and hid the Three which he had made; and there was war, and the land was laid waste, and the gate of Moria was shut\n",

      "\n",
      "I beheld the last combat on the slopes of Orodruin, where Gil-galad died, and Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath him; but Sauron himself was overthrown, and Isildur cut the Ring from his hand with the hilt-shard of his father’s sword, and took it for his own\n",
      "\n",
      "’At this the stranger, Boromir, broke in\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "He alone stood by his father in that last mortal contest; and by Gil-galad only Círdan stood, and I\n",
      "\n",
      "But Isildur would not listen to our counsel\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ “This I will have as weregild for my father, and my brother,” he said; and therefore whether we would or no, he took it to treasure it\n",
      "\n",

      "Many Elves and many mighty Men, and many of their friends, had perished in the war\n",
      "\n",

      "Never again shall there be any such league of Elves and Men; for Men multiply and the Firstborn decrease, and the two kindreds are estranged\n",

      "\n",
      "‘In the North after the war and the slaughter of the Gladden Fields the Men of Westernesse were diminished, and their city of Annúminas beside Lake Evendim fell into ruin; and the heirs of Valandil removed and dwelt at Fornost on the high North Downs, and that now too is desolate\n",
      "\n",
      "Men call it Deadmen’s Dike, and they fear to tread there\n",

      "High towers that people built, and strong places, and havens of many ships; and the winged crown of the Kings of Men was held in awe by folk of many tongues\n",

      "Their chief city was Osgiliath, Citadel of the Stars, through the midst of which the River flowed\n",
      "\n",
      "And Minas Ithil they built, Tower of the Rising Moon, eastward upon a shoulder of the Mountains of Shadow; and westward at the feet of the White Mountains Minas Anor they made, Tower of the Setting Sun\n",

      "There in the courts of the King grew a white tree, from the seed of that tree which Isildur brought over the deep waters, and the seed of that tree before came from Eressëa, and before that out of the Uttermost West in the Day before days when the world was young\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But in the wearing of the swift years of Middle-earth the line of Meneldil son of Anárion failed, and the Tree withered, and the blood of the Númenóreans became mingled with that of lesser men\n",

      "Then the watch upon the walls of Mordor slept, and dark things crept back to Gorgoroth\n",
      "\n",
      "And on a time evil things came forth, and they took Minas Ithil and abode in it, and they made it into a place of dread; and it is called Minas Morgul, the Tower of Sorcery\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Minas Anor was named anew Minas Tirith, the Tower of Guard; and these two cities were ever at war, but Osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walked\n",

      "He was shaken by a sudden shame and fear; and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the Ring, and a loathing of its touch\n",

      "For the Sword that was Broken is the Sword of Elendil that broke beneath him when he fell\n",

      "Now you have seen the sword that you have sought, what would you ask? Do you wish for the House of Elendil to return to the Land of Gondor?’\n",

      "\n",
      "‘You speak for me also,’ he cried, and turning to Elrond he said: ‘The Wise may have good reason to believe that the halfling’s trove is indeed the Great Ring of long debate, unlikely though that may seem to those who know less\n",

      "\n",
      "Some, too, will remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, and for long we watched him only\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet at last, as his shadow grew, Saruman yielded, and the Council put forth its strength and drove the evil out of Mirkwood – and that was in the very year of the finding of this Ring: a strange chance, if chance it was\n",

      "‘But we were too late, as Elrond foresaw\n",

      "Sauron also had watched us, and had long prepared against our stroke, governing Mordor from afar through Minas Morgul, where his Nine servants dwelt, until all was ready\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he gave way before us, but only feigned to flee, and soon after came to the Dark Tower and openly declared himself\n",
      "\n",
      "Then for the last time the Council met; for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the One\n",
      "\n",
      "We feared then that he had some news of it that we knew nothing of\n",
      "\n",
      "But Saruman said nay, and repeated what he had said to us before: that the One would never again be found in Middle-earth\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ “At the worst,” said he, “our Enemy knows that we have it not, and that it still is lost\n",

      "\n",

      "‘From the first my heart misgave me, against all reason that I knew,’ said Gandalf, ‘and I desired to know how this thing came to Gollum, and how long he had possessed it\n",
      "\n",
      "So I set a watch for him, guessing that he would ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure\n",
      "\n",
      "He came, but he escaped and was not found\n",
      "\n",
      "And then alas! I let the matter rest, watching and waiting only, as we have too often done\n",

      "‘Time passed with many cares, until my doubts were awakened again to sudden fear\n",
      "\n",
      "Whence came the hobbit’s ring? What, if my fear was true, should be done with it? Those things I must decide\n",

      "\n",
      "‘That was seventeen years ago\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon I became aware that spies of many sorts, even beasts and birds, were gathered round the Shire, and my fear grew\n",
      "\n",
      "I called for the help of the Dúnedain, and their watch was doubled; and I opened my heart to Aragorn, the heir of Isildur\n",
      "\n",
      "And I,’ said Aragorn, ‘counselled that we should hunt for Gollum, too late though it may seem\n",
      "\n",
      "And since it seemed fit that Isildur’s heir should labour to repair Isildur’s fault, I went with Gandalf on the long and hopeless search\n",

      "\n",
      "‘There we had rumour of him, and we guess that he dwelt there long in the dark hills; but we never found him, and at last I despaired\n",
      "\n",
      "And then in my despair I thought again of a test that might make the finding of Gollum unneeded\n",
      "\n",
      "The ring itself might tell if it were the One\n",
      "\n",
      "The memory of words at the Council came back to me: words ofSaruman, half-heeded at the time\n",

      "\n",
      "In former days the members of my order had been well received there, but Saruman most of all\n",

      "Often he had been for long the guest of the Lords of the City\n",

      "\n",
      "And yet there lie in his hoards many records that few even of the lore-masters now can read, for their scripts and tongues have become dark to later men\n",
      "\n",
      "And Boromir, there lies in Minas Tirith still, unread, I guess, by any save Saruman and myself since the kings failed, a scroll that Isildur made himself\n",
      "\n",
      "For Isildur did not march away straight from the war in Mordor, as some have told the tale\n",

      "In that time he planted there the last sapling of the White Tree in memory of his brother\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "For this scroll concerns the Ring, and thus wrote Isildur therein:The Great Ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the North Kingdom; but records of it shall be left in Gondor, where also dwell the heirs of Elendil, lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow dim\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And after these words Isildur described the Ring, such as he found it\n",
      "\n",
      "It was hot when I first took it, hot as a glede, and my hand was scorched, so that I doubt if ever again I shall be free of the pain of it\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet even as I write it is cooled, and it seemeth to shrink, though it loseth neither its beauty nor its shape\n",
      "\n",
      "Already the writing upon it, which at first was as clear as red flame, fadeth and is now only barely to be read\n",
      "\n",
      "It is fashioned in an elven-script of Eregion, for they have no letters in Mordor for such subtle work; but the language is unknown to me\n",
      "\n",
      "I deem it to be a tongue of the Black Land, since it is foul and uncouth\n",
      "\n",
      "What evil it saith I do not know; but I trace here a copy of it, lest it fade beyond recall\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring misseth, maybe, the heat of Sauron’s hand, which was black and yet burned like fire, and so Gil-galad was destroyed; and maybe were the gold made hot again, the writing would be refreshed\n",
      "\n",
      "But for my part I will risk no hurt to this thing: of all the works of Sauron the only fair\n",

      "\n",
      "For in the day that Sauron first put on the One, Celebrimbor, maker of the Three, was aware of him, and from afar he heard him speak these words, and so his evil purposes were revealed\n",

      "Therefore I went first to meet him and hear his tale\n",

      "He will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, and I was not gentle\n",

      "Nothing more did I ever get from his mouth than the marks of his teeth\n",
      "\n",
      "I deemed it the worst part of all my journey, the road back, watching him day and night, making him walk before me with a halter on his neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and food, driving him ever towards Mirkwood\n",
      "\n",
      "I brought him there at last and gave him to the Elves, for we had agreed that this should be done; and I was glad to be rid of his company, for he stank\n",

      "Fear was ever in my heart for my friends in the Shire; but still I had some hope\n",
      "\n",
      "I hoped that Frodo had set forth at once, as my letter had urged, and that he had reached Rivendell before the deadly pursuit began\n",
      "\n",
      "And both my fear and my hope proved ill-founded\n",
      "\n",
      "For my hope was founded on a fat man in Bree; and my fear was founded on the cunning of Sauron\n",
      "\n",
      "But fat men who sell ale have many calls to answer; and the power of Sauron is still less than fear makes it\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the circle of Isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy to think that the hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the Shire far away\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw you!’ cried Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You were walking backwards and forwards\n",
      "\n",
      "The moon shone in your hair\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It was only a dream,’ said Frodo, ‘but it suddenly came back to me\n",
      "\n",
      "I had quite forgotten it\n",
      "\n",
      "It came some time ago; after I left the Shire, I think\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it was late in coming,’ said Gandalf, ‘as you will see\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in an evil plight\n",
      "\n",
      "And those who know me will agree that I have seldom been in such need, and do not bear such misfortune well\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf the Grey caught like a fly in a spider’s treacherous web! Yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread\n",
      "\n",
      "‘At first I feared, as Saruman no doubt intended, that Radagast had also fallen\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet I had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in his eye at our meeting\n",
      "\n",
      "If I had, I should never have gone to Isengard, or I should have gone more warily\n",
      "\n",
      "So Saruman guessed, and he had concealed his mind and deceived his messenger\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been useless in any case to try and win over the honest Radagast to treachery\n",
      "\n",
      "He sought me in good faith, and so persuaded me\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That was the undoing of Saruman’s plot\n",
      "\n",
      "For Radagast knew no reason why he should not do as I asked; and he rode away towards Mirkwood where he had many friends of old\n",
      "\n",
      "And the Eagles of the Mountains went far and wide, and they saw many things: the gathering of wolves and the mustering of Orcs; and the Nine Riders going hither and thither in the lands; and they heard news of the escape of Gollum\n",
      "\n",
      "And they sent a messenger to bring these tidings to me\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So it was that when summer waned, there came a night of moon, and Gwaihir the Windlord, swiftest of the Great Eagles, came unlooked-for to Orthanc; and he found me standing on the pinnacle\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I spoke to him and he bore me away, before Saruman was aware\n",
      "\n",
      "I was far from Isengard, ere the wolves and orcs issued from the gate to pursue me\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ “How far can you bear me?” I said to Gwaihir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ “Many leagues,” said he, “but not to the ends of the earth\n",
      "\n",
      "I was sent to bear tidings not burdens\n",
      "\n",
      "”‘ “Then I must have a steed on land,” I said, “and a steed surpassingly swift, for I have never had such need of haste before\n",
      "\n",
      "”‘ “Then I will bear you to Edoras, where the Lord of Rohan sits in his halls,” he said; “for that is not very far off\n",
      "\n",
      "” And I was glad, for in the Riddermark of Rohan the Rohirrim, the Horse-lords, dwell, and there are no horses like those that are bred in that great vale between the Misty Mountains and the White\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ “Are the Men of Rohan still to be trusted, do you think?” I said to Gwaihir, for the treason of Saruman had shaken my faith\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ “They pay a tribute of horses,” he answered, “and send many yearly to Mordor, or so it is said; but they are not yet under the yoke\n",
      "\n",
      "But if Saruman has become evil, as you say, then their doom cannot be long delayed\n",
      "\n",
      "”‘He set me down in the land of Rohan ere dawn; and now I have lengthened my tale over long\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest must be more brief\n",
      "\n",
      "In Rohan I found evil already at work: the lies of Saruman; and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings\n",
      "\n",
      "He bade me take a horse and be gone; and I chose one much to my liking, but little to his\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the best horse in his land, and I have never seen the like of him\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he must be a noble beast indeed,’ said Aragorn; ‘and it grieves me more than many tidings that might seem worse to learn that Sauron levies such tribute\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not so when last I was in that land\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is it now, I will swear,’ said Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is a lie that comes from the Enemy\n",
      "\n",
      "I know the Men of Rohan, true and valiant, our allies, dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago\n",
      "\n",
      "The shadow of Mordor lies on distant lands,’ answered Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Saruman has fallen under it\n",
      "\n",
      "Rohan is beset\n",
      "\n",
      "Who knows what you will find there, if ever you return?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not this at least,’ said Boromir, ‘that they will buy their lives with horses\n",
      "\n",
      "They love their horses next to their kin\n",
      "\n",
      "And not without reason, for the horses of the Riddermark come from the fields of the North, far from the Shadow, and their race, as that of their masters, is descended from the free days of old\n",
      "\n",
      "True indeed!’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And there is one among them that might have been foaled in the morning of the world\n",
      "\n",
      "The horses of the Nine cannot vie with him; tireless, swift as the flowing wind\n",
      "\n",
      "Shadowfax they called him\n",
      "\n",
      "By day his coat glistens like silver; and by night it is like a shade, and he passes unseen\n",
      "\n",
      "Light is his footfall! Never before had any man mounted him, but I took him and I tamed him, and so speedily he bore me that I reached the Shire when Frodo was on the Barrow-downs, though I set out from Rohan only when he set out from Hobbiton\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But fear grew in me as I rode\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever as I came north I heard tidings of the Riders, and though I gained on them day by day, they were ever before me\n",
      "\n",
      "They had divided their forces, I learned: some remained on the eastern borders, not far from the Greenway, and some invaded the Shire from the south\n",
      "\n",
      "I came to Hobbiton and Frodo had gone; but I had words with old Gamgee\n",
      "\n",
      "Many words and few to the point\n",
      "\n",
      "He had much to say about the shortcomings of the new owners of Bag End\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ “I can’t abide changes,” said he, “not at my time of life, and least of all changes for the worst\n",
      "\n",
      "” “Changes for the worst,” he repeated many times\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ “Worst is a bad word,” I said to him, “and I hope you do not live to see it\n",
      "\n",
      "” But amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton less than a week before, and that a black horseman had come to the Hill the same evening\n",
      "\n",
      "ThenI rode on in fear\n",
      "\n",
      "I came to Buckland and found it in uproar, as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick\n",
      "\n",
      "I came to the house at Crickhollow, and it was broken open and empty; but on the threshold there lay a cloak that had been Frodo’s\n",
      "\n",
      "Then for a while hope left me, and I did not wait to gather news, or I might have been comforted; but I rode on the trail of the Riders\n",
      "\n",
      "It was hard to follow, for it went many ways, and I was at a loss\n",
      "\n",
      "But it seemed to me that one or two had ridden towards Bree; and that way I went, for I thought of words that might be said to the innkeeper\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ “Butterbur they call him,” thought I\n",
      "\n",
      "“If this delay was his fault, I will melt all the butter in him\n",
      "\n",
      "I will roast the old fool over a slow fire\n",
      "\n",
      "” He expected no less, and when he saw my face he fell down flat and began to melt on the spot\n",
      "\n",
      "What did you do to him?’ cried Frodo in alarm\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He was really very kind to us and did all that he could\n",
      "\n",
      "’Gandalf laughed\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t be afraid!’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I did not bite, and I barked very little\n",
      "\n",
      "So overjoyed was I by the news that I got out of him, when he stopped quaking, that I embraced the old fellow\n",
      "\n",
      "How it had happened I could not then guess, but I learned that you had been in Bree the night before, and had gone off that morning with Strider\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ “Strider!” I cried, shouting for joy\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ “Yes, sir, I am afraid so, sir,” said Butterbur, mistaking me\n",
      "\n",
      "“He got at them, in spite of all that I could do, and they took up with him\n",
      "\n",
      "They behaved very queer all the time they were here: wilful, you might say\n",
      "\n",
      "”‘ “Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy and beloved Barliman!” said I\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the best news I have had since Midsummer; it’s worth a gold piece at the least\n",
      "\n",
      "May your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for seven years!” said I\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now I can take a night’s rest, the first since I have forgotten when\n",
      "\n",
      "”‘So I stayed there that night, wondering much what had become of the Riders; for only of two had there yet been any news in Bree, it seemed\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the night we heard more\n",
      "\n",
      "Five at least came from the west, and they threw down the gates and passed through Bree like a howling wind; and the Bree-folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world\n",
      "\n",
      "I got up before dawn and went after them\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not know, but it seems clear to me that this is what happened\n",
      "\n",
      "Their Captain remained in secret away south of Bree, while two rode ahead through the village, and four more invaded the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "But when these were foiled in Bree and at Crickhollow, they returned to their Captain with tidings, and so left the Road unguarded for a while, except by their spies\n",
      "\n",
      "The Captain then sent some eastward straight across country, and he himself with the rest rode along the Road in great wrath\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I galloped to Weathertop like a gale, and I reached it before sundown on my second day from Bree – and they were there before me\n",
      "\n",
      "They drew away from me, for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it while the Sun was in the sky\n",
      "\n",
      "But they closed round at night, and I was besieged on the hill-top, in the old ring of Amon Sûl\n",
      "\n",
      "I was hard put to it indeed: such light and flame cannot have been seen on Weathertop since the war-beacons of old\n",
      "\n",
      "‘At sunrise I escaped and fled towards the north\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not hope to do more\n",
      "\n",
      "It was impossible to find you, Frodo, in the wilderness, and it would have been folly to try with all the Nine at my heels\n",
      "\n",
      "So I had to trust to Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "But I hoped to draw some of them off, and yet reach Rivendell ahead of you and send out help\n",
      "\n",
      "Four Riders did indeed follow me, but they turned back after a while and made for the Ford, it seems\n",
      "\n",
      "That helped a little, for there were only five, not nine, when your camp was attacked\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I reached here at last by a long hard road, up the Hoarwell and through the Ettenmoors, and down from the north\n",
      "\n",
      "It took me nearly fifteen days from Weathertop, for I could not ride among the rocks of the troll-fells, and Shadowfax departed\n",
      "\n",
      "I sent him back to his master; but a great friendship has grown between us, and if I have need he will come at my call\n",
      "\n",
      "But so it was that I came to Rivendell only two days before the Ring, and news of its peril had already been brought here – which proved well indeed\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And that, Frodo, is the end of my account\n",
      "\n",
      "May Elrond and the others forgive the length of it\n",
      "\n",
      "But such a thing has not happened before, that Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised\n",
      "\n",
      "An account to the Ring-bearer of so strange an event was required, I think\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, the Tale is now told, from first to last\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we all are, and here is the Ring\n",
      "\n",
      "But we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "What shall we do with it?’There was a silence\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Elrond spoke again\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is grievous news concerning Saruman,’ he said; ‘for we trusted him and he is deep in all our counsels\n",
      "\n",
      "It is perilous to study too deeply the arts of the Enemy, for good or for ill\n",
      "\n",
      "But such falls and betrayals, alas, have happened before\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the tales that we have heard this day the tale of Frodo was most strange to me\n",
      "\n",
      "I have known few hobbits, save Bilbo here; and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as I had thought him\n",
      "\n",
      "The world has changed much since I last was on the westward roads\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Barrow-wights we know by many names; and of the Old Forest many tales have been told: all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern march\n",
      "\n",
      "Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now the Shire to Dunland west of Isengard\n",
      "\n",
      "In those lands I journeyed once, and many things wild and strange I knew\n",
      "\n",
      "But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago, and even then was older than the old\n",
      "\n",
      "That was not then his name\n",
      "\n",
      "Iarwain Ben-adar we called him, oldest and fatherless\n",
      "\n",
      "But many another name he has since been given by other folk: Forn by the Dwarves, Orald by Northern Men, and other names beside\n",
      "\n",
      "He is a strange creature, but maybe I should have summoned him to our Council\n",
      "\n",
      "He would not have come,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help?’ asked Erestor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It seems that he has a power even over the Ring\n",
      "\n",
      "No, I should not put it so,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Say rather that the Ring has no power over him\n",
      "\n",
      "He is his own master\n",
      "\n",
      "But he cannot alter the Ring itself, nor break its power over others\n",
      "\n",
      "And now he is withdrawn into a little land, within bounds that he has set, though none can see them, waiting perhaps for a change of days, and he will not step beyond them\n",
      "\n",
      "But within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him,’ said Erestor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Would he not take the Ring and keep it there, for ever harmless?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No,’ said Gandalf, ‘not willingly\n",
      "\n",
      "He might do so, if all the free folk of the world begged him, but he would not understand the need\n",
      "\n",
      "And if he were given the Ring, he would soon forget it, or most likely throw it away\n",
      "\n",
      "Such things have no hold on his mind\n",
      "\n",
      "He would be a most unsafe guardian; and that alone is answer enough\n",
      "\n",
      "But in any case,’ said Glorfindel, ‘to send the Ring to him would only postpone the day of evil\n",
      "\n",
      "He is far away\n",
      "\n",
      "We could not now take it back to him, unguessed, unmarked by any spy\n",
      "\n",
      "And even if we could, soon or late the Lord of the Rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his power towards it\n",
      "\n",
      "Could that power be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that in the end, if all else is conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last as he was First; and then Night will come\n",
      "\n",
      "I know little of Iarwain save the name,’ said Galdor; ‘but Glorfindel, I think, is right\n",
      "\n",
      "Power to defy our Enemy is not in him, unless such power is in the earth itself\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet we see that Sauron can torture and destroy the very hills\n",
      "\n",
      "What power still remains lies with us, here in Imladris, or with Círdan at the Havens, or in Lórien\n",
      "\n",
      "But have they the strength, have we here the strength to withstand the Enemy, the coming of Sauron at the last, when all else is overthrown?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have not the strength,’ said Elrond; ‘neither have they\n",
      "\n",
      "Then if the Ring cannot be kept from him for ever by strength,’ said Glorfindel, ‘two things only remain for us to attempt: to send it over the Sea, or to destroy it\n",
      "\n",
      "But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess,’ said Elrond\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And they who dwell beyond the Sea would not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth; it is for us who still dwell here to deal with it\n",
      "\n",
      "Then,’ said Glorfindel, ‘let us cast it into the deeps, and so make the lies of Saruman come true\n",
      "\n",
      "For it is clear now that even at the Council his feet were already on a crooked path\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew that the Ring was not lost for ever, but wished us to think so; for he began to lust for it for himself\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet oft in lies truth is hidden: in the Sea it would be safe\n",
      "\n",
      "Not safe for ever,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There are many things in the deep waters; and seas and lands may change\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is not our part here to take thought only for a season, or for a few lives of Men, or for a passing age of the world\n",
      "\n",
      "We should seek a final end of this menace, even if we do not hope to make one\n",
      "\n",
      "And that we shall not find on the roads to the Sea,’ said Galdor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If the return to Iarwain be thought too dangerous, then flight to the Sea is now fraught with gravest peril\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart tells me that Sauron will expect us to take the western way, when he learns what has befallen\n",
      "\n",
      "He soon will\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nine have been unhorsed indeed, but that is but a respite, ere they find new steeds and swifter\n",
      "\n",
      "Only the waning might of Gondor stands now between him and a march in power along the coasts into the North; and if he comes, assailing the White Towers and the Havens, hereafter the Elves may have no escape from the lengthening shadows of Middle-earth\n",
      "\n",
      "Long yet will that march be delayed,’ said Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Gondor wanes, you say\n",
      "\n",
      "But Gondor stands, and even the end of its strength is still very strong\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the Nine,’ said Galdor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard\n",
      "\n",
      "Then,’ said Erestor, ‘there are but two courses, as Glorfindel already has declared: to hide the Ring for ever; or to unmake it\n",
      "\n",
      "But both are beyond our power\n",
      "\n",
      "Who will read this riddle for us?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘None here can do so,’ said Elrond gravely\n",
      "\n",
      "‘At least none can foretell what will come to pass, if we take this road or that\n",
      "\n",
      "But it seems to me now clear which is the road that we must take\n",
      "\n",
      "The westward road seems easiest\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore it must be shunned\n",
      "\n",

      "‘Rope!’ he muttered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No rope! And only last night you said to yourself: “Sam, what about a bit of rope? You’ll want it, if you haven’t got it\n",
      "\n",
      "” Well, I’ll want it\n",
      "\n",
      "I can’t get it now\n",
      "\n",
      "’At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, and he called the Company to him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is my last word,’ he said in a low voice\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom\n",
      "\n",
      "On him alone is any charge laid: neither to cast away the Ring, nor to deliver it to any servant of the Enemy nor indeed to let any handle it, save members of the Company and the Council, and only then in gravest need\n",
      "\n",
      "The others go with him as free companions, to help him on his way\n",
      "\n",
      "You may tarry, or come back, or turn aside into other paths, as chance allows\n",
      "\n",
      "The further you go, the less easy will it be to withdraw; yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further than you will\n",
      "\n",
      "For you do not yet know the strength of your hearts, and you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road\n",
      "\n",
      "Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens,’ said Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Maybe,’ said Elrond, ‘but let him not vow to walk in the dark, who has not seen the nightfall\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,’ said Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Or break it,’ said Elrond\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Look not too far ahead! But go now with good hearts! Farewell, and may the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free Folk go with you\n",
      "\n",
      "May the stars shine upon your faces!’\n",

      "‘I don’t suppose you will be able to keep a diary, Frodo my lad, but I shall expect a full account when you get back\n",
      "\n",
      "And don’t be too long! Farewell!’Many others of Elrond’s household stood in the shadows and watched them go, bidding them farewell with soft voices\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no laughter, and no song or music\n",
      "\n",
      "At last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk\n",
      "\n",
      "They crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that led out of the cloven vale of Rivendell; and they came at length to the high moor where the wind hissed through the heather\n",
      "\n",
      "Then with one glance at the Last Homely House twinkling below them they strode away far into the night\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Ford of Bruinen they left the Road and turning southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded lands\n",
      "\n",
      "Their purpose was to hold this course west of the Mountains for many miles and days\n",
      "\n",
      "The country was much rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the Great River in Wilderland on the other side of the range, and their going would be slow; but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "The spies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country, and the paths were little known except to the people of Rivendell\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this land even in the dark\n",
      "\n",
      "The others were in file behind, and Legolas whose eyes were keen was the rearguard\n",
      "\n",
      "The first part of their journey was hard and dreary, and Frodo remembered little of it, save the wind\n",
      "\n",
      "For many sunless days an icy blast came from the Mountains in the east, and no garment seemed able to keep out its searching fingers\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the Company was well clad, they seldom felt warm, either moving or at rest\n",
      "\n",
      "They slept uneasily during the middle of the day, in some hollow of the land, or hidden under the tangled thorn-bushes that grew in thickets in many places\n",
      "\n",
      "In the late afternoon they were roused by the watch, and took their chief meal: cold and cheerless as a rule, for they could seldom risk the lighting of a fire\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening they went on again, always as nearly southward as they could find a way\n",
      "\n",
      "At first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and stumbled until they were weary, they were creeping forward like snails, and getting nowhere\n",
      "\n",
      "Each day the land looked much the same as it had the day before\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer\n",
      "\n",
      "South of Rivendell they rose ever higher, and bent westwards; and about the feet of the main range there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills, and deep valleys filled with turbulent waters\n",
      "\n",
      "Paths were few and winding, and led them often only to the edge of some sheer fall, or down into treacherous swamps\n",
      "\n",
      "They had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the south\n",
      "\n",
      "The swift-flowing clouds lifted and melted away, and the sun came out, pale and bright\n",
      "\n",
      "There came a cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night-march\n",
      "\n",
      "The travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly-trees whose grey-green trunks seemed to have been built out of the very stone of the hills\n",
      "\n",
      "Their dark leaves shone and their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun\n",
      "\n",
      "Away in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the path that the Company was taking\n",
      "\n",
      "At the left of this high range rose three peaks; the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped with snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was still largely in the shadow, but where the sunlight slanted upon it, it glowed red\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf stood at Frodo’s side and looked out under his hand\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We have done well,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We have reached the borders of the country that Men call Hollin; many Elves lived here in happier days, when Eregion was its name\n",
      "\n",
      "Five-and-forty leagues as the crow flies we have come, though many long miles further our feet have walked\n",
      "\n",
      "The land and the weather will be milder now, but perhaps all the more dangerous\n",
      "\n",
      "Dangerous or not, a real sunrise is mighty welcome,’ said Frodo, throwing back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But the mountains are ahead of us,’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We must have turned eastwards in the night\n",
      "\n",
      "No,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But you see further ahead in the clear light\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond those peaks the range bends round south-west\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many maps in Elrond’s house, but I suppose you never thought to look at them?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes I did, sometimes,’ said Pippin, ‘but I don’t remember them\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo has a better head for that sort of thing\n",
      "\n",
      "I need no map,’ said Gimli, who had come up with Legolas, and was gazing out before him with a strange light in his deep eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There is the land where our fathers worked of old, and we have wrought the image of those mountains into many works of metal and of stone, and into many songs and tales\n",
      "\n",
      "They stand tall in our dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shathûr\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life, but I know them and their names, for under them lies Khazad-dûm, the Dwarrowdelf, that is now called the Black Pit, Moria in the Elvish tongue\n",
      "\n",
      "Yonder stands Barazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are Silvertine and Cloudyhead: Celebdil the White, and Fanuidhol the Grey, that we call Zirakzigil and Bundushathûr\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There the Misty Mountains divide, and between their arms lies the deep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the Dimrill Dale, which the Elves call Nanduhirion\n",
      "\n",
      "It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If we climb the pass that is called the Redhorn Gate, under the far side of Caradhras, we shall come down by the Dimrill Stair into the deep vale of the Dwarves\n",
      "\n",
      "There lies the Mirrormere, and there the River Silverlode rises in its icy springs\n",
      "\n",
      "Dark is the water of Kheled-zâram,’ said Gimli, ‘and cold are the springs of Kibil-nâla\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart trembles at the thought that I may see them soon\n",
      "\n",
      "May you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf!’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But whatever you may do, we at least cannot stay in that valley\n",
      "\n",
      "We must go down the Silverlode into the secret woods, and so to the Great River, and then——’He paused\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, and where then?’ asked Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘To the end of the journey – in the end,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We cannot look too far ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us be glad that the first stage is safely over\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we will rest here, not only today but tonight as well\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a wholesome air about Hollin\n",
      "\n",
      "Much evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets the Elves, if once they dwelt there\n",
      "\n",
      "That is true,’ said Legolas\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But the Elves of this land were of a race strange to us of the silvan folk, and the trees and the grass do not now remember them\n",
      "\n",
      "Only I hear the stones lament them: deep they delved us, fair they wrought us, high they builded us; but they are gone\n",
      "\n",
      "They are gone\n",
      "\n",
      "They sought the Havens long ago\n",
      "\n",
      "’That morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes of holly, and their supper-breakfast was merrier than it had been since they set out\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not hurry to bed afterwards, for they expected to have all the night to sleep in, and they did not mean to go on again until the evening of the next day\n",
      "\n",
      "Only Aragorn was silent and restless\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while he left the Company and wandered on to the ridge; there he stood in the shadow of a tree, looking out southwards and westwards, with his head posed as if he was listening\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he returned to the brink of the dell and looked down at the others laughing and talking\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is the matter, Strider?’ Merry called up\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What are you looking for? Do you miss the East Wind?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No indeed,’ he answered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I miss something\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been in the country of Hollin in many seasons\n",
      "\n",
      "No folk dwell here now, but many other creatures live here at all times, especially birds\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet now all things but you are silent\n",
      "\n",
      "I can feel it\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no sound for miles about us, and your voices seem to make the ground echo\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not understand it\n",
      "\n",
      "’Gandalf looked up with sudden interest\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But what do you guess is the reason?’ he asked\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Is there more in it than surprise at seeing four hobbits, not to mention the rest of us, where people are so seldom seen or heard?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hope that is it,’ answered Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I have a sense of watchfulness, and of fear, that I have never had here before\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we must be more careful,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you bring a Ranger with you, it is well to pay attention to him, especially if the Ranger is Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, and set the watch\n",
      "\n",
      "’It was Sam’s turn that day to take the first watch, but Aragorn joined him\n",
      "\n",
      "The others fell asleep\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the silence grew until even Sam felt it\n",
      "\n",
      "The breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard\n",
      "\n",
      "The swish of the pony’s tail and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam could hear his own joints creaking, if he stirred\n",
      "\n",
      "Dead silence was around him, and over all hung a clear blue sky, as the Sun rode up from the East\n",
      "\n",
      "Away in the South a dark patch appeared, and grew, and drove north like flying smoke in the wind\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What’s that, Strider? It don’t look like a cloud,’ said Sam in a whisper to Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no answer, he was gazing intently at the sky; but before long Sam could see for himself what was approaching\n",
      "\n",
      "Flocks of birds, flying at great speed, were wheeling and circling, and traversing all the land as if they were searching for something; and they were steadily drawing nearer\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Lie flat and still!’ hissed Aragorn, pulling Sam down into the shade of a holly-bush; for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from the main host, and came, flying low, straight towards the ridge\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam thought they were a kind of crow of large size\n",
      "\n",
      "As they passed overhead, in so dense a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below, one harsh croak was heard\n",
      "\n",
      "Not until they had dwindled into the distance, north and west, and the sky was again clear would Aragorn rise\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he sprang up and went and wakened Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the Mountains and the Greyflood,’ he said, ‘and they have passed over Hollin\n",
      "\n",
      "They are not natives here; they are crebain out of Fangorn and Dunland\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know what they are about: possibly there is some trouble away south from which they are fleeing; but I think they are spying out the land\n",
      "\n",
      "I have also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we ought to move again this evening\n",
      "\n",
      "Hollin is no longer wholesome for us: it is being watched\n",
      "\n",
      "And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate,’ said Gandalf; ‘and how we can get over that without being seen, I cannot imagine\n",
      "\n",
      "But we will think of that when we must\n",
      "\n",
      "As for moving as soon as it is dark, I am afraid that you are right\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily our fire made little smoke, and had burned low before the crebain came,’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It must be put out and not lit again\n",
      "\n",
      "Well if that isn’t a plague and a nuisance!’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "The news: no fire, and a move again by night, had been broken to him, as soon as he woke in the late afternoon\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All because of a pack of crows! I had looked forward to a real good meal tonight: something hot\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, you can go on looking forward,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you\n",
      "\n",
      "For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in comfort, and warmer feet\n",
      "\n",
      "However, we are certain of one thing at any rate: it will get warmer as we get south\n",
      "\n",
      "Too warm, I shouldn’t wonder,’ muttered Sam to Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I’m beginning to think it’s time we got a sight of that Fiery Mountain, and saw the end of the Road, so to speak\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought at first that this here Redhorn, or whatever its name is, might be it, till Gimli spoke his piece\n",
      "\n",
      "A fair jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!’ Maps conveyed nothing to Sam’s mind, and all distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite out of his reckoning\n",
      "\n",
      "All that day the Company remained in hiding\n",
      "\n",
      "The dark birds passed over now and again; but as the westering Sun grew red they disappeared southwards\n",
      "\n",
      "At dusk the Company set out, and turning now half east they steered their course towards Caradhras, which far away still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished Sun\n",
      "\n",
      "One by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded\n",
      "\n",
      "Guided by Aragorn they struck a good path\n",
      "\n",
      "It looked to Frodo like the remains of an ancient road, that had once been broad and well planned, from Hollin to the mountain-pass\n",
      "\n",
      "The Moon, now at the full, rose over the mountains, and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of them looked to have been worked by hands, though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak, barren land\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn, and the moon was low\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo looked up at the sky\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the high stars, as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out again\n",
      "\n",
      "He shivered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Did you see anything pass over?’ he whispered to Gandalf, who was just ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, but I felt it, whatever it was,’ he answered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It may be nothing, only a wisp of thin cloud\n",
      "\n",
      "It was moving fast then,’ muttered Aragorn, ‘and not with the wind\n",
      "\n",
      "’Nothing further happened that night\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning dawned even brighter than before\n",
      "\n",
      "But the air was chill again; already the wind was turning back towards the east\n",
      "\n",
      "For two more nights they marched on, climbing steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills, and the mountains towered up, nearer and nearer\n",
      "\n",
      "On the third morning Caradhras rose before them, a mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer naked sides, dull red as if stained with blood\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a black look in the sky, and the sun was wan\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind had gone now round to the north-east\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf snuffed the air and looked back\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Winter deepens behind us,’ he said quietly to Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The heights away north are whiter than they were; snow is lying far down their shoulders\n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the Redhorn Gate\n",
      "\n",
      "We may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path, and waylaid by some evil; but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you think of your course now, Aragorn?’Frodo overheard these words, and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn were continuing some debate that had begun long before\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened anxiously\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well, Gandalf,’ answered Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And perils known and unknown will grow as we go on\n",
      "\n",
      "But we must go on; and it is no good our delaying the passage of the mountains\n",
      "\n",
      "Further south there are no passes, till one comes to the Gap of Rohan\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not trust that way since your news of Saruman\n",
      "\n",
      "Who knows which side now the marshals of the Horse-lords serve?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who knows indeed!’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But there is another way, and not by the pass of Caradhras: the dark and secret way that we have spoken of\n",
      "\n",
      "But let us not speak of it again! Not yet\n",
      "\n",
      "Say nothing to the others, I beg, not until it is plain that there is no other way\n",
      "\n",
      "We must decide before we go further,’ answered Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then let us weigh the matter in our minds, while the others rest and sleep,’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "In the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast, Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras\n",
      "\n",
      "Its sides were now dark and sullen, and its head was in grey cloud\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo watched them, wondering which way the debate would go\n",
      "\n",
      "When they returned to the Company Gandalf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face the weather and the high pass\n",
      "\n",
      "He was relieved\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not guess what was the other dark and secret way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill Aragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it had been abandoned\n",
      "\n",
      "‘From signs that we have seen lately,’ said Gandalf, ‘I fear that the Redhorn Gate may be watched; and also I have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind\n",
      "\n",

      "When we leave here, where there are still a few trees and bushes, each of us should carry a faggot of wood, as large as he can bear\n",

      "\n",
      "The narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left, above which the grim flanks of Caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom; on the right was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine\n",

      "Soon even Boromir found it hard to keep going\n",

      "The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind the taller folk, but it was plain that they could not go much further, if the snow continued\n",

      "They heard eerie noises in the darkness round them\n",
      "\n",
      "It may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall, but the sounds were those of shrill cries, and wild howls of laughter\n",
      "\n",
      "Stones began to fall from the mountain-side, whistling over their heads, or crashing on the path beside them\n",
      "\n",

      "Some have been in this world longer than he\n",

      "‘It is no good going on\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a little higher, if I remember rightly, this path leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard slope\n",
      "\n",
      "We should have no shelter there from snow, or stones – or anything else\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is no good going back while the storm holds,’ said Aragorn\n",

      "It faced southwards, and near the bottom it leaned out a little, so that they hoped it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and from the falling stones\n",
      "\n",
      "But eddying blasts swirled round them from every side, and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds\n",
      "\n",
      "They huddled together with their backs to the wall\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits, and screened them a little; but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks, and it went on mounting\n",
      "\n",
      "If they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon have been entirely buried\n",
      "\n",
      "A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and hazy dream\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought a fire was heating his toes, and out of the shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard Bilbo’s voice speaking\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t think much of your diary, he said\n",
      "\n",
      "Snowstorms on January the twelfth: there was no need to come back to report that!But I wanted rest and sleep, Bilbo, Frodo answered with an effort, when he felt himself shaken, and he came back painfully to wakefulness\n",
      "\n",
      "Boromir had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This will be the death of the halflings, Gandalf,’ said Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads\n",
      "\n",
      "We must do something to save ourselves\n",
      "\n",
      "Give them this,’ said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a leathern flask\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Just a mouthful each – for all of us\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very precious\n",
      "\n",
      "It is miruvor, the cordial of Imladris\n",
      "\n",
      "Elrond gave it to me at our parting\n",
      "\n",
      "Pass it round!’As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a new strength of heart, and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs\n",
      "\n",
      "The others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour\n",
      "\n",
      "But the snow did not relent\n",
      "\n",
      "It whirled about them thicker than ever, and the wind blew louder\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘The choice seems near now between fire and death, Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "Doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us, but that will not help us\n",
      "\n",
      "You may make a fire, if you can,’ answered Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If there are any watchers that can endure this storm, then they can see us, fire or no\n",
      "\n",
      "’But though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of Boromir, it passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel\n",
      "\n",
      "At last reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand\n",
      "\n",
      "Picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment, and then with a word of command, naur an edraith ammen! he thrust the end of his staff into the midst of it\n",
      "\n",
      "At once a great spout of green and blue flame sprang out, and the wood flared and sputtered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If there are any to see, then I at least am revealed to them,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have written Gandalf is here in signs that all can read from Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin\n",
      "\n",
      "’But the Company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "Their hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire\n",
      "\n",
      "The wood burned merrily; and though all round it the snow hissed, and pools of slush crept under their feet, they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze\n",
      "\n",
      "There they stood, stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames\n",
      "\n",
      "A red light was on their tired and anxious faces; behind them the night was like a black wall\n",
      "\n",
      "But the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire burned low, and the last faggot was thrown on\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The night is getting old,’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The dawn is not far off\n",
      "\n",
      "If any dawn can pierce these clouds,’ said Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "Boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The snow is growing less,’ he said, ‘and the wind is quieter\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire; but for a long time he could see no sign of their slackening\n",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly, as sleep was beginning to creep over him again, he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen, and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer\n",
      "\n",
      "Very slowly a dim light began to grow\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the snow stopped altogether\n",
      "\n",
      "As the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world\n",
      "\n",
      "Below their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was altogether lost; but the heights above were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow\n",
      "\n",
      "Gimli looked up and shook his head\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Caradhras has not forgiven us,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He has more snow yet to fling at us, if we go on\n",
      "\n",
      "The sooner we go back and down the better\n",
      "\n",
      "’To this all agreed, but their retreat was now difficult\n",
      "\n",
      "It might well prove impossible\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits; in places it had been scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a path for you,’ said Legolas\n",
      "\n",
      "The storm had troubled him little, and he alone of the Company remained still light of heart\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun to save us,’ answered Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I must have something to work on\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot burn snow\n",
      "\n",
      "Well,’ said Boromir, ‘when heads are at a loss bodies must serve, as we say in my country\n",
      "\n",
      "The strongest of us must seek a way\n",
      "\n",
      "See! Though all is now snow-clad, our path, as we came up, turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder\n",
      "\n",
      "It was there that the snow first began to burden us\n",
      "\n",
      "If we could reach that point, maybe it would prove easier beyond\n",
      "\n",
      "It is no more than a furlong off, I guess\n",
      "\n",
      "Then let us force a path thither, you and I!’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "Aragorn was the tallest of the Company, but Boromir, little less in height, was broader and heavier in build\n",
      "\n",
      "He led the way, and Aragorn followed him\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly they moved off, and were soon toiling heavily\n",
      "\n",
      "In places the snow was breast-high, and often Boromir seemed to be swimming or burrowing with his great arms rather than walking\n",
      "\n",
      "Legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, and then he turned to the others\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The strongest must seek a way, say you? But I say: let a ploughman plough, but choose an otter for swimming, and for running light over grass and leaf, or over snow – an Elf\n",
      "\n",
      "’With that he sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if for the first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint in the snow\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Farewell!’ he said to Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I go to find the Sun!’ Then swift as a runner over firm sand he shot away, and quickly overtaking the toiling men, with a wave of his hand he passed them, and sped into the distance, and vanished round the rocky turn\n",
      "\n",
      "The others waited huddled together, watching until Boromir and Aragorn dwindled into black specks in the whiteness\n",
      "\n",
      "At length they too passed from sight\n",
      "\n",
      "The time dragged on\n",
      "\n",
      "The clouds lowered, and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour, maybe, went by, though it seemed far longer, and then at last they saw Legolas coming back\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time Boromir and Aragorn reappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well,’ cried Legolas as he ran up, ‘I have not brought the Sun\n",
      "\n",
      "She is walking in the blue fields of the South, and a little wreath of snow on this Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have brought back a gleam of good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet\n",
      "\n",
      "There is the greatest wind-drift of all just beyond the turn, and there our Strong Men were almost buried\n",
      "\n",
      "They despaired, until I returned and told them that the drift was little wider than a wall\n",
      "\n",
      "And on the other side the snow suddenly grows less, while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a hobbit’s toes\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, it is as I said,’ growled Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It was no ordinary storm\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the ill will of Caradhras\n",
      "\n",
      "He does not love Elves and Dwarves, and that drift was laid to cut off our escape\n",
      "\n",
      "But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you have Men with you,’ said Boromir, who came up at that moment\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And doughty Men too, if I may say it; though lesser men with spades might have served you better\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, we have thrust a lane through the drift; and for that all here may be grateful who cannot run as light as Elves\n",
      "\n",
      "But how are we to get down there, even if you have cut through the drift?’ said Pippin, voicing the thought of all the hobbits\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Have hope!’ said Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am weary, but I still have some strength left, and Aragorn too\n",
      "\n",
      "We will bear the little folk\n",
      "\n",
      "The others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us\n",
      "\n",
      "Come, Master Peregrin! I will begin with you\n",
      "\n",
      "’He lifted up the hobbit\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Cling to my back! I shall need my arms,’ he said and strode forward\n",
      "\n",
      "Aragorn with Merry came behind\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin marvelled at his strength, seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other tool than his great limbs\n",
      "\n",
      "Even now, burdened as he was, he was widening the track for those who followed, thrusting the snow aside as he went\n",
      "\n",
      "They came at length to the great drift\n",
      "\n",
      "It was flung across the mountain-path like a sheer and sudden wall, and its crest, sharp as if shaped with knives, reared up more than twice the height of Boromir; but through the middle a passage had been beaten, rising and falling like a bridge\n",
      "\n",
      "On the far side Merry and Pippin were set down, and there they waited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to arrive\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while Boromir returned carrying Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind in the narrow but now well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill with Gimli perched among the baggage\n",
      "\n",
      "Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "They passed through the lane; but hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall of stones and slithering snow\n",
      "\n",
      "The spray of it half blinded the Company as they crouched against the cliff, and when the air cleared again they saw that the path was blocked behind them\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Enough, enough!’ cried Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We are departing as quickly as we may!’ And indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be expended, as if Caradhras was satisfied that the invaders had been beaten off and would not dare to return\n",
      "\n",
      "The threat of snow lifted; the clouds began to break and the light grew broader\n",
      "\n",
      "As Legolas had reported, they found that the snow became steadily more shallow as they went down, so that even the hobbits could trudge along\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning was now far advanced\n",
      "\n",
      "From the high place they looked back westwards over the lower lands\n",
      "\n",
      "Far away in the tumble of country that lay at the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to climb the pass\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo’s legs ached\n",
      "\n",
      "He was chilled to the bone and hungry; and his head was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill\n",
      "\n",
      "Black specks swam before his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "He rubbed them, but the black specks remained\n",
      "\n",
      "In the distance below him, but still high above the lower foothills, dark dots were circling in the air\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The birds again!’ said Aragorn, pointing down\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That cannot be helped now,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",

      "Together they led the Company back towards the mountains\n",
      "\n",
      "The only road of old to Moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream, the Sirannon, that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors had stood\n",
      "\n",
      "But either Gandalf was astray, or else the land had changed in recent years; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it, only a few miles southwards from their start\n",

      "Their hearts sank\n",

      "Hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow channel\n",
      "\n",
      "It was empty and silent, and hardly a trickle of water flowed among the brown and red-stained stones of its bed; but on the near side there was a path, much broken and decayed, that wound its way among the ruined walls and paving-stones of an ancient highroad\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah! Here it is at last!’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is where the stream ran: Sirannon, the Gate-stream, they used to call it\n",

      "\n",
      "After a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again\n",
      "\n",
      "Before them the mountains frowned, but their path lay in a deep trough of land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward peaks\n",
      "\n",
      "At length they came to a sharp bend\n",
      "\n",
      "There the road, which had been veering southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the land to the left, turned and went due east again\n",
      "\n",
      "Rounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a broken and jagged top\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "How far it stretched away southward they could not see in the failing light; but its northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood, and between the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the water’s edge there was a rim of open ground\n",
      "\n",
      "They hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was making for; and then he had still to find the doors\n",

      "\n",
      "As Sam, the last of the Company, led Bill up on to the dry ground on the far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning quickly they saw ripples, black-edged with shadow in the waning light: great rings were widening outwards from a point far out in the lake\n",

      "\n",
      "The dusk deepened, and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud\n",

      "Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as quickly as they could\n",
      "\n",
      "They reached the strip of dry land between the lake and the cliffs: it was narrow, often hardly a dozen yards across, and encumbered with fallen rock and stones; but they found a way, hugging the cliff, and keeping as far from the dark water as they might\n",
      "\n",
      "A mile southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees\n",
      "\n",
      "Stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows, the remains it seemed of old thickets, or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley\n",
      "\n",
      "But close under the cliff there stood, still strong and living, two tall trees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined\n",
      "\n",
      "Their great roots spread from the wall to the water\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes, when seen far off from the top of the Stair; but now they towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing deep night-shadows about their feet, standing like sentinel pillars at the end of the road\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, here we are at last!’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Here the Elvenway from Hollin ended\n",

      "Those were happier days, when there was still close friendship at times between folk of different race, even between Dwarves and Elves\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Go with words of guard and guiding on you,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You are a wise beast, and have learned much in Rivendell\n",
      "\n",
      "Make your ways to places where you can find grass, and so come in time to Elrond’s house, or wherever you wish to go\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There, Sam! He will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and getting home as we have\n",
      "\n",

      "Sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife\n",
      "\n",
      "The arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out for help\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty other arms came rippling out\n",
      "\n",
      "The dark water boiled, and there was a hideous stench\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Into the gateway! Up the stairs! Quick!’ shouted Gandalf leaping back\n",
      "\n",
      "Rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to the ground where they stood, he drove them forward\n",
      "\n",
      "They were just in time\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up, and Gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff-wall and the doors\n",
      "\n",
      "One came wriggling over the threshold, glistening in the starlight\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf turned and paused\n",
      "\n",
      "If he was considering what word would close the gate again from within, there was no need\n",
      "\n",
      "Many coiling arms seized the doors on either side, and with horrible strength, swung them round\n",
      "\n",
      "With a shattering echo they slammed, and all light was lost\n",
      "\n",
      "A noise of rending and crashing came dully through the ponderous stone\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam, clinging to Frodo’s arm, collapsed on a step in the black darkness\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Poor old Bill!’ he said in a choking voice\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Poor old Bill! Wolves and snakes! But the snakes were too much for him\n",
      "\n",
      "I had to choose, Mr# Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "I had to come with you\n",
      "\n",
      "’They heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the doors\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled, but the doors did not open\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, well!’ said the wizard\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The passage is blocked behind us now, and there is only one way out – on the other side of the mountains\n",
      "\n",
      "I fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up, and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry; for the trees were beautiful, and had stood so long\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot first touched the water,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What was the thing, or were there many of them?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not know,’ answered Gandalf; ‘but the arms were all guided by one purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "Something has crept, or has been driven out of dark waters under the mountains\n",
      "\n",
      "There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it was that dwelt in the lake, it had seized on Frodo first among all the Company\n",
      "\n",
      "Boromir muttered under his breath, but the echoing stone magnified the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear: ‘In the deep places of the world! And thither we are going against my wish\n",
      "\n",
      "Who will lead us now in this deadly dark?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will,’ said Gandalf, ‘and Gimli shall walk with me\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow my staff!’As the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps, he held his staff aloft, and from its tip there came a faint radiance\n",
      "\n",
      "The wide stairway was sound and undamaged\n",
      "\n",
      "Two hundred steps they counted, broad and shallow; and at the top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into the dark\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Let us sit and rest and have something to eat, here on the landing, since we can’t find a dining-room!’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "He had begun to shake off the terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt extremely hungry\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the upper steps, dim figures in the gloom\n",
      "\n",
      "After they had eaten, Gandalf gave them each a third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It will not last much longer, I am afraid,’ he said; ‘but I think we need it after that horror at the gate\n",
      "\n",
      "And unless we have great luck, we shall need all that is left before we see the other side! Go carefully with the water, too! There are many streams and wells in the Mines, but they should not be touched\n",
      "\n",
      "We may not have a chance of filling our skins and bottles till we come down into Dimrill Dale\n",
      "\n",
      "How long is that going to take us?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I cannot say,’ answered Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It depends on many chances\n",
      "\n",
      "But going straight, without mishap or losing our way, we shall take three or four marches, I expect\n",
      "\n",
      "It cannot be less than forty miles from West-door to East-gate in a direct line, and the road may wind much\n",
      "\n",
      "’After only a brief rest they started on their way again\n",
      "\n",
      "All were eager to get the journey over as quickly as possible, and were willing, tired as they were, to go on marching still for several hours\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf walked in front as before\n",
      "\n",
      "In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light of which just showed the ground before his feet; in his right he held his sword Glamdring\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting in the dim light as he turned his head from side to side\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind the dwarf walked Frodo, and he had drawn the short sword, Sting\n",
      "\n",
      "No gleam came from the blades of Sting or of Glamdring; and that was some comfort, for being the work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Orcs were near at hand\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind Frodo went Sam, and after him Legolas, and the young hobbits, and Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dark at the rear, grim and silent, walked Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "The passage twisted round a few turns, and then began to descend\n",
      "\n",
      "It went steadily down for a long while before it became level once again\n",
      "\n",
      "The air grew hot and stifling, but it was not foul, and at times they felt currents of cooler air upon their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings in the walls\n",
      "\n",
      "There were many of these\n",
      "\n",
      "In the pale ray of the wizard’s staff, Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches, and of other passages and tunnels, sloping up, or running steeply down, or opening blankly dark on either side\n",
      "\n",
      "It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering\n",
      "\n",
      "Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage\n",
      "\n",
      "At least he was not, as were most of the others, troubled by the mere darkness in itself\n",
      "\n",
      "Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mines of Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of Gimli, Glóin’s son, dwarf of the mountain-race though he was\n",
      "\n",
      "To Gandalf the far-off memories of a journey long before were now of little help, but even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do not be afraid!’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a pause longer than usual, and Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together; the others were crowded behind, waiting anxiously\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do not be afraid! I have been with him on many a journey, if never on one so dark; and there are tales in Rivendell of greater deeds of his than any that I have seen\n",
      "\n",
      "He will not go astray – if there is any path to find\n",
      "\n",
      "He has led us in here against our fears, but he will lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself\n",
      "\n",
      "He is surer of finding the way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen Berúthiel\n",
      "\n",
      "’It was well for the Company that they had such a guide\n",
      "\n",
      "They had no fuel nor any means of making torches; in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been left behind\n",
      "\n",
      "But without any light they would soon have come to grief\n",
      "\n",
      "There were not only many roads to choose from, there were also in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells beside the path in which their passing feet echoed\n",
      "\n",
      "There were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor, and every now and then a crack would open right before their feet\n",
      "\n",
      "The widest was more than seven feet across, and it was long before Pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap\n",
      "\n",
      "The noise of churning water came up from far below, as if some great mill-wheel was turning in the depths\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Rope!’ muttered Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I knew I’d want it, if I hadn’t got it!’As these dangers became more frequent their march became slower\n",
      "\n",
      "Already they seemed to have been tramping on, on, endlessly to the mountains’ roots\n",
      "\n",
      "They were more than weary, and yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of halting anywhere\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo’s spirits had risen for a while after his escape, and after food and a draught of the cordial; but now a deep uneasiness, growing to dread, crept over him again\n",
      "\n",
      "Though he had been healed in Rivendell of the knife-stroke, that grim wound had not been without effect\n",
      "\n",
      "His senses were sharper and more aware of things that could not be seen\n",
      "\n",
      "One sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in the dark than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "And he was in any case the bearer of the Ring: it hung upon its chain against his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt the certainty of evil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing\n",
      "\n",
      "He gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried whispers\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no sound but the sound of their own feet: the dull stump of Gimli’s dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of Boromir; the light step of Legolas; the soft, scarce-heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the rear the slow firm footfalls of Aragorn with his long stride\n",
      "\n",
      "When they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all, unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine that he heard, something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet\n",
      "\n",
      "It was never loud enough, or near enough, for him to feel certain that he heard it; but once it had started it never stopped, while the Company was moving\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself, and then grew still\n",
      "\n",
      "It was after nightfall when they had entered the Mines\n",
      "\n",
      "They had been going for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf came to his first serious check\n",
      "\n",
      "Before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three passages: all led in the same general direction, eastwards; but the left-hand passage plunged down, while the right-hand climbed up, and the middle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but very narrow\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have no memory of this place at all!’ said Gandalf, standing uncertainly under the arch\n",
      "\n",
      "He held up his staff in the hope of finding some marks or inscription that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was to be seen\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am too weary to decide,’ he said, shaking his head\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And I expect that you are all as weary as I am, or wearier\n",
      "\n",
      "We had better halt here for what is left of the night\n",
      "\n",
      "You know what I mean! In here it is ever dark; but outside the late Moon is riding westward and the middle-night has passed\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor old Bill!’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wonder where he is\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope those wolves haven’t got him yet\n",
      "\n",
      "’To the left of the great arch they found a stone door: it was half closed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Steady! Steady!’ cried Gandalf, as Merry and Pippin pushed forward, glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in the open passage\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Steady! You do not know what is inside yet\n",
      "\n",
      "I will go first\n",
      "\n",
      "’He went in cautiously, and the others filed behind\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There!’ he said, pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor\n",
      "\n",
      "Before his feet they saw a large round hole like the mouth of a well\n",
      "\n",
      "Broken and rusty chains lay at the edge and trailed down into the black pit\n",
      "\n",
      "Fragments of stone lay near\n",
      "\n",
      "‘One of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were going to strike the bottom,’ said Aragorn to Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Let the guide go first while you have one\n",
      "\n",
      "This seems to have been a guardroom, made for the watching of the three passages,’ said Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That hole was plainly a well for the guards’ use, covered with a stone lid\n",
      "\n",
      "But the lid is broken, and we must all take care in the dark\n",
      "\n",
      "’Pippin felt curiously attracted by the well\n",
      "\n",
      "While the others were unrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber, as far as possible from the hole in the floor, he crept to the edge and peered over\n",
      "\n",
      "A chill air seemed to strike his face, rising from invisible depths\n",
      "\n",
      "Moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone, and let it drop\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound\n",
      "\n",
      "Then far below, as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place, there came a plunk, very distant, but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What’s that?’ cried Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "He was relieved when Pippin confessed what he had done; but he was angry, and Pippin could see his eye glinting\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Fool of a Took!’ he growled\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is a serious journey, not a hobbit walking-party\n",
      "\n",
      "Throw yourself in next time, and then you will be no further nuisance\n",
      "\n",
      "Now be quiet!’Nothing more was heard for several minutes; but then there came out of the depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom\n",
      "\n",
      "They stopped, and when the echoes had died away, they were repeated: tap-tom, tom-tap, tap-tap, tom\n",
      "\n",
      "They sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort; but after a while the knocking died away and was not heard again\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That was the sound of a hammer, or I have never heard one,’ said Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Gandalf, ‘and I do not like it\n",
      "\n",
      "It may have nothing to do with Peregrin’s foolish stone; but probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray, do nothing of the kind again! Let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble\n",
      "\n",
      "You, Pippin, can go on the first watch, as a reward,’ he growled, as he rolled himself in a blanket\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on turning round, fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the well\n",
      "\n",
      "He wished he could cover the hole, if only with a blanket, but he dared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually Gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent\n",
      "\n",
      "He was deep in thought, trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the Mines, and considering anxiously the next course that he should take; a false turn now might be disastrous\n",
      "\n",
      "After an hour he rose up and came over to Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Get into a corner and have a sleep, my lad,’ he said in a kindly tone\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You want to sleep, I expect\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot get a wink, so I may as well do the watching\n",
      "\n",
      "I know what is the matter with me,’ he muttered, as he sat down by the door\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I need smoke! I have not tasted it since the morning before the snowstorm\n",
      "\n",
      "’The last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled on the floor, shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his knees\n",
      "\n",
      "The flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose, and the puff of smoke\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "He had sat and watched all alone for about six hours, and had let the others rest\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And in the watches I have made up my mind,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not like the feel of the middle way; and I do not like the smell of the left-hand way: there is foul air down there, or I am no guide\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall take the right-hand passage\n",
      "\n",
      "It is time we began to climb up again\n",
      "\n",
      "’For eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they marched on; and they met no danger, and heard nothing, and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the wizard’s light, bobbing like a will-o’-the-wisp in front of them\n",
      "\n",
      "The passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as they could judge it went in great mounting curves, and as it rose it grew loftier and wider\n",
      "\n",
      "There were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on either side, and the floor was level and sound, without pits or cracks\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidently they had struck what once had been an important road; and they went forward quicker than they had done on their first march\n",
      "\n",
      "In this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in a direct line east, though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more\n",
      "\n",
      "As the road climbed upwards, Frodo’s spirits rose a little; but he still felt oppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard, away behind the Company and beyond the fall and patter of their feet, a following footstep that was not an echo\n",
      "\n",
      "They had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest, and all were thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls to right and left vanished\n",
      "\n",
      "They seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into a black and empty space\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a great draught of warmer air behind them, and before them the darkness was cold on their faces\n",
      "\n",
      "They halted and crowded anxiously together\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf seemed pleased\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I chose the right way,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘At last we are coming to the habitable parts, and I guess that we are not far now from the eastern side\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are high up, a good deal higher than the Dimrill Gate, unless I am mistaken\n",
      "\n",
      "From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hall\n",
      "\n",
      "I will now risk a little real light\n",
      "\n",
      "’He raised his staff, and for a brief instant there was a blaze like a flash of lightning\n",
      "\n",
      "Great shadows sprang up and fled, and for a second they saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone\n",
      "\n",
      "Before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black walls, polished and smooth as glass, flashed and glittered\n",
      "\n",
      "Three other entrances they saw, dark black arches: one straight before them eastwards, and one on either side\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the light went out\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That is all that I shall venture on for the present,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There used to be great windows on the mountain-side, and shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the Mines\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we have reached them now, but it is night outside again, and we cannot tell until morning\n",
      "\n",
      "If I am right, tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the meanwhile we had better go no further\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us rest, if we can\n",
      "\n",
      "Things have gone well so far, and the greater part of the dark road is over\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are not through yet, and it is a long way down to the Gates that open on the world\n",
      "\n",
      "’The Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled close together in a corner to escape the draught: there seemed to be a steady inflow of chill air through the eastern archway\n",
      "\n",
      "All about them as they lay hung the darkness, hollow and immense, and they were oppressed by the loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and passages\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "His broad flat face was swart, his eyes were like coals, and his tongue was red; he wielded a great spear\n",

      "He could not catch what was said\n",
      "\n",
      "The walls seemed to be trembling\n",
      "\n",
      "Every now and again the drum-beats throbbed and rolled: doom, doom\n",

      "Suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud\n",

      "Gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the Company\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, well! That’s over!’ said the wizard struggling to his feet\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have done all that I could\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have met my match, and have nearly been destroyed\n",

      "But don’t stand here! Go on! You will have to do without light for a while: I am rather shaken\n",
      "\n",
      "Go on! Go on! Where are you, Gimli? Come ahead with me! Keep close behind, all of you!’They stumbled after him wondering what had happened\n",
      "\n",
      "Doom, doom went the drum-beats again: they now sounded muffled and far away, but they were following\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no other sound of pursuit, neither tramp of feet, nor any voice\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf took no turns, right or left, for the passage seemed to be going in the direction that he desired\n",
      "\n",
      "Every now and again it descended a flight of steps, fifty or more, to a lower level\n",

      "\n",
      "At the end of an hour they had gone a mile, or maybe a little more, and had descended many flights of stairs\n",
      "\n",
      "There was still no sound of pursuit\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost they began to hope that they would escape\n",
      "\n",
      "At the bottom of the seventh flight Gandalf halted\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is getting hot!’ he gasped\n",
      "\n",

      "I am very weary\n",

      "\n",
      "I could think of nothing to do but to try and put a shutting-spell on the door\n",
      "\n",
      "I know many; but to do things of that kind rightly requires time, and even then the door can be broken by strength\n",
      "\n",
      "‘As I stood there I could hear orc-voices on the other side: at any moment I thought they would burst it open\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not hear what was said; they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language\n",
      "\n",
      "All I caught was ghâsh: that is “fire”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then something came into the chamber – I felt it through the door, and the orcs themselves were afraid and fell silent\n",
      "\n",
      "It laid hold of the iron ring, and then it perceived me and my spell\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What it was I cannot guess, but I have never felt such a challenge\n",
      "\n",
      "The counter-spell was terrible\n",
      "\n",
      "It nearly broke me\n",
      "\n",
      "For an instant the door left my control and began to open! I had to speak a word of Command\n",
      "\n",
      "That proved too great a strain\n",
      "\n",
      "The door burst in pieces\n",
      "\n",
      "Something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the light inside, and I was thrown backwards down the stairs\n",
      "\n",
      "All the wall gave way, and the roof of the chamber as well, I think\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am afraid Balin is buried deep, and maybe something else is buried there too\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot say\n",
      "\n",
      "But at least the passage behind us was completely blocked\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah! I have never felt so spent, but it is passing\n",
      "\n",
      "And now what about you, Frodo? There was not time to say so, but I have never been more delighted in my life than when you spoke\n",
      "\n",
      "I feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that Aragorn was carrying\n",
      "\n",
      "What about me?’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am alive, and whole I think\n",
      "\n",
      "I am bruised and in pain, but it is not too bad\n",
      "\n",
      "Well,’ said Aragorn, ‘I can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff so tough that I have never met the like of it\n",
      "\n",
      "Had I known, I would have spoken softer in the Inn at Bree! That spear-thrust would have skewered a wild boar!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, it did not skewer me, I am glad to say,’ said Frodo; ‘though I feel as if I had been caught between a hammer and an anvil\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He said no more\n",
      "\n",
      "He found breathing painful\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘There is more about you than meets the eye, as I said of him long ago\n",
      "\n",
      "’ Frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said\n",
      "\n",
      "They now went on again\n",
      "\n",
      "Before long Gimli spoke\n",
      "\n",
      "He had keen eyes in the dark\n",
      "\n",

      "But it is not daylight\n",
      "\n",
      "It is red\n",
      "\n",
      "What can it be?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ghâsh!’ muttered Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wonder if that is what they meant: that the lower levels are on fire? Still, we can only go on\n",
      "\n",
      "’Soon the light became unmistakable, and could be seen by all\n",
      "\n",
      "It was flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them\n",
      "\n",
      "They could now see their way: in front the road sloped down swiftly, and some way ahead there stood a low archway; through it the growing light came\n",
      "\n",
      "The air became very hot\n",
      "\n",
      "When they came to the arch Gandalf went through, signing to them to wait\n",
      "\n",
      "As he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red glow\n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly he stepped back\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There is some new devilry here,’ he said, ‘devised for our welcome, no doubt\n",
      "\n",
      "But I know now where we are: we have reached the First Deep, the level immediately below the Gates\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the Second Hall of Old Moria; and the Gates are near: away beyond the eastern end, on the left, not more than a quarter of a mile\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the Bridge, up a broad stair, along a wide road, through the First Hall, and out! But come and look!’They peered out\n",
      "\n",
      "Before them was another cavernous hall\n",
      "\n",
      "It was loftier and far longer than the one in which they had slept\n",
      "\n",
      "They were near its eastern end; westward it ran away into darkness\n",
      "\n",
      "Down the centre stalked a double line of towering pillars\n",
      "\n",
      "They were carved like boles of mighty trees whose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone\n",
      "\n",
      "Their stems were smooth and black, but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides\n",
      "\n",
      "Right across the floor, close to the feet of two huge pillars a great fissure had opened\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of it a fierce red light came, and now and again flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns\n",
      "\n",
      "Wisps of dark smoke wavered in the hot air\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls, we should have been trapped here,’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Let us hope that the fire now lies between us and pursuit\n",
      "\n",
      "Come! There is no time to lose\n",
      "\n",
      "’Even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum-beat: Doom, doom, doom\n",
      "\n",
      "Away beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came cries and horn-calls\n",
      "\n",
      "Doom, doom: the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now for the last race!’ said Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If the sun is shining outside, we may still escape\n",

      "After me!’He turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall\n",
      "\n",
      "The distance was greater than it had looked\n",
      "\n",
      "As they ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behind\n",
      "\n",
      "A shrill yell went up: they had been seen\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a ring and clash of steel\n",

      "At the end of the hall the floor vanished and fell to an unknown depth\n",
      "\n",
      "The outer door could only be reached by a slender bridge of stone, without kerb or rail, that spanned the chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an ancient defence of the Dwarves against any enemy that might capture the First Hall and the outer passages\n",

      "‘We will do this, though it is against our liking\n",
      "\n",
      "If Aragorn and Legolas will guard him, and answer for him, he shall pass; but he must go blindfold through Lothlórien\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But now we must debate no longer\n",
      "\n",
      "Your folk must not remain on the ground\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been keeping watch on the rivers, ever since we saw a great troop of Orcs going north towards Moria, along the skirts of the mountains, many days ago\n",
      "\n",
      "Wolves are howling on the wood’s borders\n",
      "\n",

      "Tomorrow early you must go on\n",

      "‘The four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with us – we do not fear them! There is another talan in the next tree\n",
      "\n",
      "There the others must take refuge\n",
      "\n",
      "You, Legolas, must answer to us for them\n",
      "\n",
      "Call us, if anything is amiss! And have an eye on that dwarf!’Legolas at once went down the ladder to take Haldir’s message; and soon afterwards Merry and Pippin clambered up on to the high flet\n",
      "\n",
      "They were out of breath and seemed rather scared\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There!’ said Merry panting\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Strider has hidden all the rest of our baggage in a deep drift of leaves\n",
      "\n",
      "You had no need of your burdens,’ said Haldir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is cold in the tree-tops in winter, though the wind tonight is in the South; but we have food and drink to give you that will drive away the night-chill, and we have skins and cloaks to spare\n",
      "\n",
      "’The hobbits accepted this second (and far better) supper very gladly\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they wrapped themselves warmly, not only in the fur-cloaks of the Elves, but in their own blankets as well, and tried to go to sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "But weary as they were only Sam found that easy to do\n",
      "\n",
      "Hobbits do not like heights, and do not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs\n",
      "\n",
      "The flet was not at all to their liking as a bedroom\n",
      "\n",
      "It had no walls, not even a rail; only on one side was there a light plaited screen, which could be moved and fixed in different places according to the wind\n",
      "\n",
      "Pippin went on talking for a while\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I hope, if I do go to sleep in this bird-loft, that I shan’t roll off,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Once I do get to sleep,’ said Sam, ‘I shall go on sleeping, whether I roll off or no\n",
      "\n",
      "And the less said, the sooner I’ll drop off, if you take my meaning\n",
      "\n",
      "’Frodo lay for some time awake, and looked up at the stars glinting through the pale roof of quivering leaves\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam was snoring at his side long before he himself closed his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "He could dimly see the grey forms of two elves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees, speaking in whispers\n",
      "\n",
      "The other had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower branches\n",
      "\n",
      "At last lulled by the wind in the boughs above, and the sweet murmur of the falls of Nimrodel below, Frodo fell asleep with the song of Legolas running in his mind\n",
      "\n",
      "Late in the night he woke\n",
      "\n",
      "The other hobbits were asleep\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "A little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on the ground below\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a ring of metal\n",
      "\n",
      "The sounds died slowly away, and seemed to go southward, on into the wood\n",
      "\n",
      "A head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a grey-hooded Elf\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked towards the hobbits\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is it?’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yrch!’ said the Elf in a hissing whisper, and cast on to the flet the rope-ladder rolled up\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Orcs!’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What are they doing?’ But the Elf had gone\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no more sounds\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the leaves were silent, and the very falls seemed to be hushed\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo sat and shivered in his wraps\n",
      "\n",
      "He was thankful that they had not been caught on the ground; but he felt that the trees offered little protection, except concealment\n",
      "\n",
      "Orcs were as keen as hounds on a scent, it was said, but they could also climb\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew out Sting: it flashed and glittered like a blue flame; and then slowly faded again and grew dull\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of the fading of his sword the feeling of immediate danger did not leave Frodo, rather it grew stronger\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up and crawled to the opening and peered down\n",
      "\n",
      "He was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements at the tree’s foot far below\n",
      "\n",
      "Not Elves; for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their movements\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing; and something seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree-trunk\n",
      "\n",
      "He stared down into the dark, holding his breath\n",
      "\n",
      "Something was now climbing slowly, and its breath came like a soft hissing through closed teeth\n",
      "\n",
      "Then coming up, close to the stem, Frodo saw two pale eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "They stopped and gazed upward unwinking\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly they turned away, and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly up through the branches\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There was something in this tree that I have never seen before,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It was not an orc\n",
      "\n",
      "It fled as soon as I touched the tree-stem\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to be wary, and to have some skill in trees, or I might have thought that it was one of you hobbits\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I did not shoot, for I dared not arouse any cries: we cannot risk battle\n",
      "\n",
      "A strong company of Orcs has passed\n",
      "\n",
      "They crossed the Nimrodel – curse their foul feet in its clean water! – and went on down the old road beside the river\n",
      "\n",
      "They seemed to pick up some scent, and they searched the ground for a while near the place where you halted\n",
      "\n",
      "The three of us could not challenge a hundred, so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices, leading them on into the wood\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people\n",
      "\n",
      "None of the Orcs will ever return out of Lórien\n",
      "\n",
      "And there will be many Elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls\n",
      "\n",
      "But you must take the road south as soon as it is fully light\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "Day came pale from the East\n",
      "\n",
      "As the light grew it filtered through the yellow leaves of the mallorn, and it seemed to the hobbits that the early sun of a cool summer’s morning was shining\n",
      "\n",
      "Pale-blue sky peeped among the moving branches\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking through an opening on the south side of the flet Frodo saw all the valley of the Silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in the breeze\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning was still young and cold when the Company set out again, guided now by Haldir and his brother Rúmil\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Farewell, sweet Nimrodel!’ cried Legolas\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree-stems\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Farewell,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to him that he would never hear again a running water so beautiful, for ever blending its innumerable notes in an endless changeful music\n",
      "\n",
      "They went back to the path that still went on along the west side of the Silverlode, and for some way they followed it southward\n",
      "\n",
      "There were the prints of orc-feet in the earth\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon Haldir turned aside into the trees and halted on the bank of the river under their shadows\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There is one of my people yonder across the stream,’ he said, ‘though you may not see him\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He gave a call like the low whistle of a bird, and out of a thicket of young trees an Elf stepped, clad in grey, but with his hood thrown back; his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun\n",
      "\n",
      "Haldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grey rope, and he caught it and bound the end about a tree near the bank\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Celebrant is already a strong stream here, as you see,’ said Haldir, ‘and it runs both swift and deep, and is very cold\n",
      "\n",
      "We do not set foot in it so far north, unless we must\n",
      "\n",
      "But in these days of watchfulness we do not make bridges\n",
      "\n",
      "This is how we cross! Follow me!’ He made his end of the rope fast about another tree, and then ran lightly along it, over the river and back again, as if he were on a road\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can walk this path,’ said Legolas; ‘but the others have not this skill\n",
      "\n",
      "Must they swim?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No!’ said Haldir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We have two more ropes\n",
      "\n",
      "We will fasten them above the other, one shoulder-high, and another half-high, and holding these the strangers should be able to cross with care\n",
      "\n",
      "’When this slender bridge had been made, the Company passed over, some cautiously and slowly, others more easily\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the hobbits Pippin proved the best for he was sure-footed, and he walked over quickly, holding only with one hand; but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam shuffled along, clutching hard, and looking down into the pale eddying water as if it was a chasm in the mountains\n",
      "\n",
      "He breathed with relief when he was safely across\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Live and learn! as my gaffer used to say\n",
      "\n",
      "Though he was thinking of gardening, not of roosting like a bird, nor of trying to walk like a spider\n",
      "\n",
      "Not even my uncle Andy ever did a trick like that!’When at length all the Company was gathered on the east bank of the Silverlode, the Elves untied the ropes and coiled two of them\n",
      "\n",
      "Rúmil, who had remained on the other side, drew back the last one, slung it on his shoulder, and with a wave of his hand went away, back to Nimrodel to keep watch\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, friends,’ said Haldir, ‘you have entered the Naith of Lórien, or the Gore, as you would say, for it is the land that lies like a spearhead between the arms of Silverlode and Anduin the Great\n",
      "\n",
      "We allow no strangers to spy out the secrets of the Naith\n",
      "\n",
      "Few indeed are permitted even to set foot there\n",
      "\n",
      "‘As was agreed, I shall here blindfold the eyes of Gimli the Dwarf\n",
      "\n",
      "The others may walk free for a while, until we come nearer to our dwellings, down in Egladil, in the Angle between the waters\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘The agreement was made without my consent,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will not walk blindfold, like a beggar or a prisoner\n",
      "\n",
      "And I am no spy\n",
      "\n",
      "My folk have never had dealings with any of the servants of the Enemy\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither have we done harm to the Elves\n",
      "\n",
      "I am no more likely to betray you than Legolas, or any other of my companions\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not doubt you,’ said Haldir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yet this is our law\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not the master of the law, and cannot set it aside\n",
      "\n",
      "I have done much in letting you set foot over Celebrant\n",
      "\n",
      "’Gimli was obstinate\n",
      "\n",
      "He planted his feet firmly apart, and laid his hand upon the haft of his axe\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will go forward free,’ he said, ‘or I will go back and seek my own land, where I am known to be true of word, though I perish alone in the wilderness\n",
      "\n",
      "You cannot go back,’ said Haldir sternly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now you have come thus far, you must be brought before the Lord and the Lady\n",
      "\n",
      "They shall judge you, to hold you or to give you leave, as they will\n",
      "\n",
      "You cannot cross the rivers again, and behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass\n",
      "\n",
      "You would be slain before you saw them\n",
      "\n",
      "’Gimli drew his axe from his belt\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘If I am still to lead this Company, you must do as I bid\n",
      "\n",
      "It is hard upon the Dwarf to be thus singled out\n",
      "\n",
      "We will all be blindfold, even Legolas\n",
      "\n",
      "That will be best, though it will make the journey slow and dull\n",
      "\n",
      "’Gimli laughed suddenly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A merry troop of fools we shall look! Will Haldir lead us all on a string, like many blind beggars with one dog? But I will be content, if only Legolas here shares my blindness\n",
      "\n",
      "I am an Elf and a kinsman here,’ said Legolas, becoming angry in his turn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now let us cry: “a plague on the stiff necks of Elves!” ’ said Aragorn\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I shall lead you well, and the paths are smooth and straight\n",

      "Alas for the folly of these days!’ said Legolas\n",

      "‘Indeed in nothing is the power of the Dark Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all those who still oppose him\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "We live now upon an island amid many perils, and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The rivers long defended us, but they are a sure guard no more; for the Shadow has crept northward all about us\n",
      "\n",
      "Some speak of departing, yet for that it already seems too late\n",
      "\n",
      "The mountains to the west are growing evil; to the east the lands are waste, and full of Sauron’s creatures; and it is rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through Rohan, and the mouths of the Great River are watched by the Enemy\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if we could come to the shores of the Sea, we should find no longer any shelter there\n",

      "\n",
      "Not even to see fair Lothlórien?’ said Haldir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Some there are among us who sing that the Shadow will draw back, and peace shall come again\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet I do not believe that the world about us will ever again be as it was of old, or the light of the Sun as it was aforetime\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Elves, I fear, it will prove at best a truce, in which they may pass to the Sea unhindered and leave the Middle-earth for ever\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas for Lothlórien that I love! It would be a poor life in a land where no mallorn grew\n",

      "\n",
      "Being deprived of sight, Frodo found his hearing and other senses sharpened\n",
      "\n",
      "He could smell the trees and the trodden grass\n",
      "\n",
      "He could hear many different notes in the rustle of the leaves overhead, the river murmuring away on his right, and the thin clear voices of birds high in the sky\n",

      "He felt the sun upon his face and hands when they passed through an open glade\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode a strange feeling had come upon him, and it deepened as he walked on into the Naith: it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of the Elder Days, and was now walking in a world that was no more\n",
      "\n",
      "In Rivendell there was memory of ancient things; in Lórien the ancient things still lived on in the waking world\n",
      "\n",
      "Evil had been seen and heard there, sorrow had been known; the Elves feared and distrusted the world outside: wolves were howling on the wood’s borders: but on the land of Lórien no shadow lay\n",
      "\n",
      "All that day the Company marched on, until they felt the cool evening come and heard the early night-wind whispering among many leaves\n",

      "Then they rested and slept without fear upon the ground; for their guides would not permit them to unbind their eyes, and they could not climb\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning they went on again, walking without haste\n",
      "\n",
      "At noon they halted, and Frodo was aware that they had passed out under the shining Sun\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he heard the sound of many voices all around him\n",
      "\n",
      "A marching host of Elves had come up silently: they were hastening towards the northern borders to guard against any attack from Moria; and they brought news, some of which Haldir reported\n",
      "\n",
      "The marauding orcs had been waylaid and almost all destroyed; the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains, and were being pursued\n",
      "\n",
      "A strange creature also had been seen, running with bent back and with hands near the ground, like a beast and yet not of beast-shape\n",
      "\n",
      "It had eluded capture, and they had not shot it, not knowing whether it was good or ill, and it had vanished down the Silverlode southward\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Also,’ said Haldir, ‘they bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim\n",
      "\n",
      "You are all to walk free, even the dwarf Gimli\n",
      "\n",

      "They were standing in an open space\n",
      "\n",
      "To the left stood a great mound, covered with a sward of grass as green as Springtime in the Elder Days\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon it, as a double crown, grew two circles of trees: the outer had bark of snowy white, and were leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness; the inner were mallorn-trees of great height, still arrayed in pale gold\n",
      "\n",
      "High amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the centre of all there gleamed a white flet\n",
      "\n",
      "At the feet of the trees, and all about the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Among them, nodding on slender stalks, were other flowers, white and palest green: they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue of the grass\n",
      "\n",
      "Over all the sky was blue, and the sun of afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Behold! You are come to Cerin Amroth,’ said Haldir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘For this is the heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago, and here is the mound of Amroth, where in happier days his high house was built\n",
      "\n",
      "Here ever bloom the winter flowers in the unfading grass: the yellow elanor, and the pale niphredil\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we will stay awhile, and come to the city of the Galadhrim at dusk\n",
      "\n",
      "’The others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass, but Frodo stood awhile still lost in wonder\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to him that he had stepped through a high window that looked on a vanished world\n",
      "\n",
      "A light was upon it for which his language had no name\n",
      "\n",
      "All that he saw was shapely, but the shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had been first conceived and drawn at the uncovering of his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for ever\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw no colour but those he knew, gold and white and blue and green, but they were fresh and poignant, as if he had at that moment first perceived them and made for them names new and wonderful\n",
      "\n",
      "In winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for spring\n",
      "\n",
      "No blemish or sickness or deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth\n",
      "\n",
      "On the land of Lórien there was no stain\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned and saw that Sam was now standing beside him, looking round with a puzzled expression, and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s sunlight and bright day, right enough,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I thought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more Elvish than anything I ever heard tell of\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel as if I was inside a song, if you take my meaning\n",
      "\n",
      "’Haldir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both thought and word\n",

      "He smiled\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You feel the power of the Lady of the Galadhrim,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Would it please you to climb with me up Cerin Amroth?’\n",
      "\n",
      "They followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass-clad slopes\n",
      "\n",
      "Though he walked and breathed, and about him living leaves and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face, Frodo felt that he was in a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had gone and passed again into the outer world, still Frodo the wanderer from the Shire would walk there, upon the grass among elanor and niphredil in fair Lothlórien\n",

      "They entered the circle of white trees\n",
      "\n",
      "As they did so the South Wind blew upon Cerin Amroth and sighed among the branches\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo stood still, hearing far off great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away, and sea-birds crying whose race had perished from the earth\n",
      "\n",
      "Haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet\n",
      "\n",
      "As Frodo prepared to follow him, he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder: never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texture of a tree’s skin and of the life within it\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt a delight in wood and the touch of it, neither as forester nor as carpenter; it was the delight of the living tree itself\n",
      "\n",
      "As he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform, Haldir took his hand and turned him towards the South\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Look this way first!’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo looked and saw, still at some distance, a hill of many mighty trees, or a city of green towers: which it was he could not tell\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of it, it seemed to him that the power and light came that held all the land in sway\n",
      "\n",
      "He longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he looked eastward and saw all the land of Lórien running down to the pale gleam of Anduin, the Great River\n",
      "\n",
      "He lifted his eyes across the river and all the light went out, and he was back again in the world he knew\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the river the land appeared flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away it rose again like a wall, dark and drear\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun that lay on Lothlórien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood,’ said Haldir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is clad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one against another and their branches rot and wither\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst upon a stony height stands Dol Guldur, where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling\n",
      "\n",
      "We fear that now it is inhabited again, and with power sevenfold\n",
      "\n",
      "A black cloud lies often over it of late\n",
      "\n",
      "In this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one to another; and ever they strive now in thought, but whereas the light perceives the very heart of the darkness, its own secret has not been discovered\n",

      "Not yet\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He turned and climbed swiftly down, and they followed him\n",
      "\n",
      "At the hill’s foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still and silent as a tree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a light was in his eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as Frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place\n",
      "\n",
      "For the grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in white, a young lord tall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue to one whom Frodo could not see\n",
      "\n",
      "Arwen vanimelda, namárië! he said, and then he drew a breath, and returning out of his thought he looked at Frodo and smiled\n",

      "Suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a pale evening sky pricked by a few early stars\n",

      "\n",
      "Upon the south side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees; its great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk, and up it towered, until its first branches, far above, opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves\n",
      "\n",
      "Beside it a broad white ladder stood, and at its foot three Elves were seated\n",
      "\n",
      "They sprang up as the travellers approached, and Frodo saw that they were tall and clad in grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long white cloaks\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "As they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew more keen\n",
      "\n",
      "Often they heard nearby Elvish voices singing, and knew that they were making songs of lamentation for his fall, for they caught his name among the sweet sad words that they could not understand\n",

      "\n",

      "It was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words\n",

      "Now these folk aren’t wanderers or homeless, and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us: they seem to belong here, more even than Hobbits do in the Shire\n",

      "No fireworks like poor old Gandalf used to show\n",

      "\n",
      "And I don’t miss Gandalf ’s fireworks, but his bushy eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice\n",
      "\n",
      "You’re right,’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And don’t think I’m finding fault\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve often wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales, but I’ve never heard of a better land than this\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s like being at home and on a holiday at the same time, if you understand me\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t want to leave\n",

      "All the same, I’m beginning to feel that if we’ve got to go on, then we’d best get it over\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s the job that’s never started as takes longest to finish, as my old gaffer used to say\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s when we leave this land that we shall miss Gandalf worse, I’m thinking\n",
      "\n",
      "I am afraid that’s only too true, Sam,’ said Frodo\n",

      "\n",
      "’Even as he spoke, they saw, as if she came in answer to their words, the Lady Galadriel approaching\n",
      "\n",
      "Tall and white and fair she walked beneath the trees\n",
      "\n",
      "She spoke no word, but beckoned to them\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning aside, she led them towards the southern slopes of the hill of Caras Galadhon, and passing through a high green hedge they came into an enclosed garden\n",
      "\n",
      "No trees grew there, and it lay open to the sky\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the western woods\n",
      "\n",
      "Down a long flight of steps the Lady went into the deep green hollow, through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain on the hill\n",
      "\n",
      "At the bottom, upon a low pedestal carved like a branching tree, stood a basin of silver, wide and shallow, and beside it stood a silver ewer\n",
      "\n",
      "With water from the stream Galadriel filled the basin to the brim, and breathed on it, and when the water was still again she spoke\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Here is the Mirror of Galadriel,’ she said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have brought you here so that you may look in it, if you will\n",
      "\n",
      "’The air was very still, and the dell was dark, and the Elf-lady beside him was tall and pale\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What shall we look for, and what shall we see?’ asked Frodo, filled with awe\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Many things I can command the Mirror to reveal,’ she answered, ‘and to some I can show what they desire to see\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Mirror will also show things unbidden, and those are often stranger and more profitable than things which we wish to behold\n",
      "\n",
      "What you will see, if you leave the Mirror free to work, I cannot tell\n",
      "\n",
      "For it shows things that were, and things that are, and things that yet may be\n",
      "\n",
      "But which it is that he sees, even the wisest cannot always tell\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you wish to look?’Frodo did not answer\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And you?’ she said, turning to Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘For this is what your folk would call magic, I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean; and they seem to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy\n",
      "\n",
      "But this, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you not say that you wished to see Elf-magic?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I did,’ said Sam, trembling a little between fear and curiosity\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’ll have a peep, Lady, if you’re willing\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And I’d not mind a glimpse of what’s going on at home,’ he said in an aside to Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It seems a terrible long time that I’ve been away\n",
      "\n",
      "But there, like as not I’ll only see the stars, or something that I won’t understand\n",
      "\n",
      "Like as not,’ said the Lady with a gentle laugh\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But come, you shall look and see what you may\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not touch the water!’Sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin\n",
      "\n",
      "The water looked hard and dark\n",
      "\n",
      "Stars were reflected in it\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s only stars, as I thought,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he gave a low gasp, for the stars went out\n",
      "\n",
      "As if a dark veil had been withdrawn, the Mirror grew grey, and then clear\n",
      "\n",
      "There was sun shining, and the branches of trees were waving and tossing in the wind\n",
      "\n",
      "But before Sam could make up his mind what it was that he saw, the light faded; and now he thought he saw Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he seemed to see himself going along a dim passage, and climbing an endless winding stair\n",
      "\n",
      "It came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something, but what it was he did not know\n",
      "\n",
      "Like a dream the vision shifted and went back, and he saw the trees again\n",
      "\n",
      "But this time they were not so close, and he could see what was going on: they were not waving in the wind, they were falling, crashing to the ground\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hi!’ cried Sam in an outraged voice\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s that Ted Sandyman a-cutting down trees as he shouldn’t\n",
      "\n",
      "They didn’t ought to be felled: it’s that avenue beyond the Mill that shades the road to Bywater\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I could get at Ted, and I’d fell him!’But now Sam noticed that the Old Mill had vanished, and a large red-brick building was being put up where it had stood\n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of folk were busily at work\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a tall red chimney nearby\n",
      "\n",
      "Black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the Mirror\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s some devilry at work in the Shire,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Elrond knew what he was about when he wanted to send Mr# Merry back\n",
      "\n",
      "’ Then suddenly Sam gave a cry and sprang away\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can’t stay here,’ he said wildly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I must go home\n",
      "\n",
      "They’ve dug up Bagshot Row, and there’s the poor old Gaffer going down the Hill with his bits of things on a barrow\n",
      "\n",
      "I must go home!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You cannot go home alone,’ said the Lady\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You did not wish to go home without your master before you looked in the Mirror, and yet you knew that evil things might well be happening in the Shire\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that the Mirror shows many things, and not all have yet come to pass\n",
      "\n",
      "Some never come to be, unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent them\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds\n",
      "\n",
      "’Sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wish I had never come here, and I don’t want to see no more magic,’ he said and fell silent\n",
      "\n",
      "After a moment he spoke again thickly, as if struggling with tears\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, I’ll go home by the long road with Mr# Frodo, or not at all,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I hope I do get back some day\n",
      "\n",
      "If what I’ve seen turns out true, somebody’s going to catch it hot!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you now wish to look, Frodo?’ said the Lady Galadriel\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You did not wish to see Elf-magic and were content\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you advise me to look?’ asked Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No,’ she said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not counsel you one way or the other\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not a counsellor\n",
      "\n",
      "You may learn something, and whether what you see be fair or evil, that may be profitable, and yet it may not\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing is both good and perilous\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet I think, Frodo, that you have courage and wisdom enough for the venture, or I would not have brought you here\n",
      "\n",
      "Do as you will!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will look,’ said Frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water\n",
      "\n",
      "At once the Mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky\n",
      "\n",
      "A long grey road wound back out of sight\n",
      "\n",
      "Far away a figure came slowly down the road, faint and small at first, but growing larger and clearer as it approached\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Frodo realized that it reminded him of Gandalf\n",
      "\n",
      "He almost called aloud the wizard’s name, and then he saw that the figure was clothed not in grey but in white, in a white that shone faintly in the dusk; and in its hand there was a white staff\n",
      "\n",
      "The head was so bowed that he could see no face, and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and went out of the Mirror’s view\n",
      "\n",
      "Doubt came into Frodo’s mind: was this a vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago, or was it Saruman?The vision now changed\n",
      "\n",
      "Brief and small but very vivid he caught a glimpse of Bilbo walking restlessly about his room\n",
      "\n",
      "The table was littered with disordered papers; rain was beating on the windows\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was a pause, and after it many swift scenes followed that Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become involved\n",
      "\n",
      "The mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before but knew at once: the Sea\n",
      "\n",
      "Darkness fell\n",
      "\n",
      "The sea rose and raged in a great storm\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he saw against the Sun, sinking blood-red into a wrack of clouds, the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of the West\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a wide river flowing through a populous city\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a white fortress with seven towers\n",
      "\n",
      "And then again a ship with black sails, but now it was morning again, and the water rippled with light, and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun\n",
      "\n",
      "A smoke as of fire and battle arose, and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey mist; and into the mist a small ship passed away, twinkling with lights\n",
      "\n",
      "It vanished, and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away\n",
      "\n",
      "But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had opened in the world of sight, and Frodo looked into emptiness\n",
      "\n",
      "In the black abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew, until it filled nearly all the Mirror\n",
      "\n",
      "So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze\n",
      "\n",
      "The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat’s, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and Frodo knew with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was one\n",
      "\n",
      "But he also knew that it could not see him – not yet, not unless he willed it\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew heavy, heavier than a great stone, and his head was dragged downwards\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the water\n",
      "\n",
      "He was slipping forward\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do not touch the water!’ said the Lady Galadriel softly\n",
      "\n",
      "The vision faded, and Frodo found that he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basin\n",
      "\n",
      "He stepped back shaking all over and looked at the Lady\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Its rays glanced upon a ring about her finger; it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light, and a white stone in it twinkled as if the Evenstar had come down to rest upon her hand\n",

      "Frodo gazed at the ring with awe; for suddenly it seemed to him that he understood\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ she said, divining his thought, ‘it is not permitted to speak of it, and Elrond could not do so\n",

      "She stood before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, and beautiful beyond enduring, terrible and worshipful\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she let her hand fall, and the light faded, and suddenly she laughed again, and lo! she was shrunken: a slender elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad\n",

      "I would ask one thing before we go,’ said Frodo, ‘a thing which I often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell\n",

      "Yet even so, as Ring-bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden, your sight is grown keener\n",

      "\n",
      "You saw the Eye of him that holds the Seven and the Nine\n",
      "\n",
      "And did you not see and recognize the ring upon my finger? Did you see my ring?’ she asked turning again to Sam\n",

      "\n",
      "Indeed I do not think that even he had any clear purpose\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe not,’ said Celeborn, ‘yet when you leave this land, you can no longer forget the Great River\n",
      "\n",
      "As some of you know well, it cannot be crossed by travellers with baggage between Lórien and Gondor, save by boat\n",
      "\n",
      "And are not the bridges of Osgiliath broken down and all the landings held now by the Enemy?\n",
      "\n",

      "Which shore will you now take?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If my advice is heeded, it will be the western shore, and the way to Minas Tirith,’ answered Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I am not the leader of the Company\n",
      "\n",
      "’ The others said nothing, and Aragorn looked doubtful and troubled\n",

      "\n",
      "‘It is not my part to choose for you; but I will help you as I may\n",

      "‘Then I will furnish your Company with boats\n",
      "\n",
      "They must be small and light, for if you go far by water, there are places where you will be forced to carry them\n",
      "\n",
      "You will come to the rapids of Sarn Gebir, and maybe at last to the great falls of Rauros where the River thunders down from Nen Hithoel; and there are other perils\n",
      "\n",
      "Boats may make your journey less toilsome for a while\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet they will not give you counsel: in the end you must leave them and the River, and turn west – or east\n",
      "\n",
      "’Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times\n",
      "\n",
      "The gift of boats comforted him much, not least because there would now be no need to decide his course for some days\n",

      "The others, too, looked more hopeful\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever perils lay ahead, it seemed better to float down the broad tide of Anduin to meet them than to plod forward with bent backs\n",
      "\n",
      "Only Sam was doubtful: he at any rate still thought boats as bad as wild horses, or worse, and not all the dangers that he had survived made him think better of them\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before noon tomorrow,’ said Celeborn\n",

      "\n",
      "Legolas went with them, for this was to be their last night in Lothlórien, and in spite of the words of Galadriel they wished to take counsel together\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time they debated what they should do, and how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the Ring; but they came to no decision\n",
      "\n",
      "It was plain that most of them desired to go first to Minas Tirith, and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the Enemy\n",
      "\n",
      "They would have been willing to follow a leader over the River and into the shadow of Mordor; but Frodo spoke no word, and Aragorn was still divided in his mind\n",
      "\n",
      "His own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go with Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor\n",
      "\n",
      "For he believed that the message of the dreams was a summons, and that the hour had come at last when the heir of Elendil should come forth and strive with Sauron for the mastery\n",
      "\n",
      "But in Moria the burden of Gandalf had been laid on him; and he knew that he could not now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in the end to go with Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet what help could he or any of the Company give to Frodo, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness?‘I shall go to Minas Tirith, alone if need be, for it is my duty,’ said Boromir; and after that he was silent for a while, sitting with his eyes fixed on Frodo, as if he was trying to read the Halfling’s thoughts\n",
      "\n",
      "At length he spoke again, softly, as if he was debating with himself\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you wish only to destroy the Ring,’ he said, ‘then there is little use in war and weapons; and the Men of Minas Tirith cannot help\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you wish to destroy the armed might of the Dark Lord, then it is folly to go without force into his domain; and folly to throw away\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He paused suddenly, as if he had become aware that he was speaking his thoughts aloud\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It would be folly to throw lives away, I mean,’ he ended\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is a choice between defending a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death\n",
      "\n",
      "At least, that is how I see it\n",
      "\n",
      "’Frodo caught something new and strange in Boromir’s glance, and he looked hard at him\n",
      "\n",
      "Plainly Boromir’s thought was different from his final words\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be folly to throw away: what? The Ring of Power? He had said something like this at the Council, but then he had accepted the correction of Elrond\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo looked at Aragorn, but he seemed deep in his own thought and made no sign that he had heeded Boromir’s words\n",
      "\n",
      "And so their debate ended\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry and Pippin were already asleep, and Sam was nodding\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was growing old\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender goods, Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for the journey\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside, and inside was the colour of cream\n",
      "\n",
      "Gimli took up one of the cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Cram,’ he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp corner and nibbled at it\n",
      "\n",
      "His expression quickly changed, and he ate all the rest of the cake with relish\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No more, no more!’ cried the Elves laughing\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You have eaten enough already for a long day’s march\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought it was only a kind of cram, such as the Dale-men make for journeys in the wild,’ said the Dwarf\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So it is,’ they answered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But we call it lembas or waybread, and it is more strengthening than any food made by Men, and it is more pleasant than cram, by all accounts\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed it is,’ said Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, it is better than the honeycakes of the Beornings, and that is great praise, for the Beornings are the best bakers that I know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes to travellers in these days\n",
      "\n",
      "You are kindly hosts!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All the same, we bid you spare the food,’ they said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Eat little at a time, and only at need\n",
      "\n",
      "For these things are given to serve you when all else fails\n",
      "\n",
      "The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them\n",
      "\n",
      "One will keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of the tall Men of Minas Tirith\n",
      "\n",
      "’The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the clothes they had brought\n",
      "\n",
      "For each they had provided a hood and cloak, made according to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadhrim wove\n",
      "\n",
      "It was hard to say of what colour they were: grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow fields by night, dusk-silver as water under the stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Are these magic cloaks?’ asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not know what you mean by that,’ answered the leader of the Elves\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They are fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this land\n",
      "\n",
      "They are Elvish robes certainly, if that is what you mean\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaf and branch, water and stone: they have the hue and beauty of all these things under the twilight of Lórien that we love; for we put the thought of all that we love into all that we make\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet they are garments, not armour, and they will not turn shaft or blade\n",
      "\n",
      "But they should serve you well: they are light to wear, and warm enough or cool enough at need\n",
      "\n",
      "And you will find them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you walk among the stones or the trees\n",
      "\n",
      "You are indeed high in the favour of the Lady! For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people\n",
      "\n",
      "’After their morning meal the Company said farewell to the lawn by the fountain\n",
      "\n",
      "Their hearts were heavy; for it was a fair place, and it had become like home to them, though they could not count the days and nights that they had passed there\n",
      "\n",
      "As they stood for a moment looking at the white water in the sunlight, Haldir came walking towards them over the green grass of the glade\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo greeted him with delight\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have returned from the Northern Fences,’ said the Elf, ‘and I am sent now to be your guide again\n",

      "The Dimrill Dale is full of vapour and clouds of smoke, and the mountains are troubled\n",
      "\n",
      "There are noises in the deeps of the earth\n",
      "\n",
      "If any of you had thought of returning northwards to your homes, you would not have been able to pass that way\n",

      "But come! Your path now goes south\n",
      "\n",
      "’As they walked through Caras Galadhon the green ways were empty; but in the trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing\n",
      "\n",
      "They themselves went silently\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Haldir led them down the southward slopes of the hill, and they came again to the great gate hung with lamps, and to the white bridge; and so they passed out and left the city of the Elves\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a deep thicket of mallorn-trees, and passed on, winding through rolling woodlands of silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards and eastwards, towards the shores of the River\n",
      "\n",
      "They had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a high green wall\n",
      "\n",
      "Passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the trees\n",
      "\n",
      "Before them lay a long lawn of shining grass, studded with golden elanor that glinted in the sun\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright margins: on the right and west the Silverlode flowed glittering; on the left and east the Great River rolled its broad waters, deep and dark\n",
      "\n",
      "On the further shores the woodlands still marched on southwards as far as eye could see, but all the banks were bleak and bare\n",
      "\n",
      "No mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond the Land of Lórien\n",
      "\n",
      "On the bank of the Silverlode, at some distance up from the meeting of the streams, there was a hythe of white stones and white wood\n",
      "\n",
      "By it were moored many boats and barges\n",
      "\n",
      "Some were brightly painted, and shone with silver and gold and green, but most were either white or grey\n",
      "\n",
      "Three small grey boats had been made ready for the travellers, and in these the Elves stowed their goods\n",
      "\n",
      "And they added also coils of rope, three to each boat\n",
      "\n",
      "Slender they looked, but strong, silken to the touch, grey of hue like the elven-cloaks\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What are these?’ asked Sam, handling one that lay upon the greensward\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Its beak shone like burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its huge white wings were half lifted\n",
      "\n",
      "A music came down the river as it drew nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship, wrought and carved with elven-skill in the likeness of a bird\n",

      "Two elves clad in white steered it with black paddles\n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind him stood Galadriel, tall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her hair, and in her hand she held a harp, and she sang\n",
      "\n",
      "Sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in the cool clear air:I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew:\n",
      "\n",
      "Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea,\n",
      "\n",
      "And by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree\n",

      "’The Swan passed on slowly to the hythe, and they turned their boats and followed it\n",
      "\n",
      "There in the last end of Egladil upon the green grass the parting feast was held; but Frodo ate and drank little, heeding only the beauty of the Lady and her voice\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed no longer perilous or terrible, nor filled with hidden power\n",
      "\n",
      "Already she seemed to him, as by men of later days Elves still at times are seen: present and yet remote, a living vision of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of Time\n",
      "\n",
      "After they had eaten and drunk, sitting upon the grass, Celeborn spoke to them again of their journey, and lifting his hand he pointed south to the woods beyond the Tongue\n",
      "\n",
      "‘As you go down the water,’ he said, ‘you will find that the trees will fail, and you will come to a barren country\n",
      "\n",
      "There the River flows in stony vales amid high moors, until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall island of the Tindrock, that we call Tol Brandir\n",
      "\n",
      "There it casts its arms about the steep shores of the isle, and falls then with a great noise and smoke over the cataracts of Rauros down into the Nindalf, the Wetwang as it is called in your tongue\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a wide region of sluggish fen where the stream becomes tortuous and much divided\n",

      "There the Entwash flows in by many mouths from the Forest of Fangorn in the west\n",
      "\n",
      "About that stream, on this side of the Great River, lies Rohan\n",
      "\n",
      "On the further side are the bleak hills of the Emyn Muil\n",

      "The wind blows from the East there, for they look out over the Dead Marshes and the Noman-lands to Cirith Gorgor and the black gates of Mordor\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Boromir, and any that go with him seeking Minas Tirith, will do well to leave the Great River above Rauros and cross the Entwash before it finds the marshes\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet they should not go too far up that stream, nor risk becoming entangled in the Forest of Fangorn\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a strange land, and is now little known\n",
      "\n",
      "But Boromir and Aragorn doubtless do not need this warning\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed we have heard of Fangorn in Minas Tirith,’ said Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But what I have heard seems to me for the most part old wives’ tales, such as we tell to our children\n",
      "\n",
      "All that lies north of Rohan is now to us so far away that fancy can wander freely there\n",
      "\n",
      "Of old Fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm; but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it, to prove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant years\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I have myself been at whiles in Rohan, but I have never crossed it northwards\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was sent out as a messenger, I passed through the Gap by the skirts of the White Mountains, and crossed the Isen and the Greyflood into Northerland\n",
      "\n",
      "A long and wearisome journey\n",
      "\n",
      "Four hundred leagues I reckoned it, and it took me many months; for I lost my horse at Tharbad, at the fording of the Greyflood\n",
      "\n",
      "After that journey, and the road I have trodden with this Company, I do not much doubt that I shall find a way through Rohan, and Fangorn too, if need be\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I need say no more,’ said Celeborn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But do not despise the lore that has come down from distant years; for oft it may chance that old wives keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know\n",
      "\n",
      "’Now Galadriel rose from the grass, and taking a cup from one of her maidens she filled it with white mead and gave it to Celeborn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now it is time to drink the cup of farewell,’ she said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Drink, Lord of the Galadhrim! And let not your heart be sad, though night must follow noon, and already our evening draweth nigh\n",
      "\n",
      "’Then she brought the cup to each of the Company, and bade them drink and farewell\n",
      "\n",
      "But when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the grass, and chairs were set for her and for Celeborn\n",
      "\n",
      "Her maidens stood silent about her, and a while she looked upon her guests\n",
      "\n",
      "At last she spoke again\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We have drunk the cup of parting,’ she said, ‘and the shadows fall between us\n",
      "\n",
      "But before you go, I have brought in my ship gifts which the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim now offer you in memory of Lothlórien\n",
      "\n",
      "’ Then she called to each in turn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Here is the gift of Celeborn and Galadriel to the leader of your Company,’ she said to Aragorn, and she gave him a sheath that had been made to fit his sword\n",
      "\n",
      "It was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves wrought of silver and gold, and on it were set in elven-runes formed of many gems the name Andúril and the lineage of the sword\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or broken even in defeat,’ she said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But is there aught else that you desire of me at our parting? For darkness will flow between us, and it may be that we shall not meet again, unless it be far hence upon a road that has no returning\n",
      "\n",
      "’And Aragorn answered: ‘Lady, you know all my desire, and long held in keeping the only treasure that I seek\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it is not yours to give me, even if you would; and only through darkness shall I come to it\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet maybe this will lighten your heart,’ said Galadriel; ‘for it was left in my care to be given to you, should you pass through this land\n",
      "\n",
      "’ Then she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green, set in a silver brooch that was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings; and as she held it up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the leaves of spring\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This stone I gave to Celebrían my daughter, and she to hers; and now it comes to you as a token of hope\n",
      "\n",
      "In this hour take the name that was foretold for you, Elessar, the Elfstone of the House of Elendil!’Then Aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast, and those who saw him wondered; for they had not marked before how tall and kingly he stood, and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen from his shoulders\n",
      "\n",
      "‘For the gifts that you have given me I thank you,’ he said, ‘O Lady of Lórien of whom were sprung Celebrían and Arwen Evenstar\n",
      "\n",
      "What praise could I say more?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lady bowed her head, and she turned then to Boromir, and to him she gave a belt of gold; and to Merry and Pippin she gave small silver belts, each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower\n",
      "\n",
      "To Legolas she gave a bow such as the Galadhrim used, longer and stouter than the bows of Mirkwood, and strung with a string of elf-hair\n",
      "\n",
      "With it went a quiver of arrows\n",
      "\n",
      "‘For you little gardener and lover of trees,’ she said to Sam, ‘I have only a small gift\n",
      "\n",
      "’ She put into his hand a little box of plain grey wood, unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Here is set G for Galadriel,’ she said; ‘but also it may stand for garden in your tongue\n",
      "\n",
      "In this box there is earth from my orchard, and such blessing as Galadriel has still to bestow is upon it\n",
      "\n",
      "It will not keep you on your road, nor defend you against any peril; but if you keep it and see your home again at last, then perhaps it may reward you\n",
      "\n",
      "Though you should find all barren and laid waste, there will be few gardens in Middle-earth that will bloom like your garden, if you sprinkle this earth there\n",
      "\n",
      "Then you may remember Galadriel, and catch a glimpse far off of Lórien, that you have seen only in our winter\n",
      "\n",
      "For our Spring and our Summer are gone by, and they will never be seen on earth again save in memory\n",
      "\n",
      "’Sam went red to the ears and muttered something inaudible, as he clutched the box and bowed as well as he could\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves?’ said Galadriel, turning to Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "‘None, Lady,’ answered Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is enough for me to have seen the Lady of the Galadhrim, and to have heard her gentle words\n",
      "\n",
      "Hear all ye Elves!’ she cried to those about her\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Let none say again that Dwarves are grasping and ungracious! Yet surely, Gimli son of Glóin, you desire something that I could give? Name it, I bid you! You shall not be the only guest without a gift\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing, Lady Galadriel,’ said Gimli, bowing low and stammering\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nothing, unless it might be – unless it is permitted to ask, nay, to name a single strand of your hair, which surpasses the gold of the earth as the stars surpass the gems of the mine\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not ask for such a gift\n",
      "\n",
      "But you commanded me to name my desire\n",
      "\n",
      "’The Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and Celeborn gazed at the Dwarf in wonder, but the Lady smiled\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is said that the skill of the Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues,’ she said; ‘yet that is not true of Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "For none have ever made to me a request so bold and yet so courteous\n",
      "\n",
      "And how shall I refuse, since I commanded him to speak? But tell me, what would you do with such a gift?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Treasure it, Lady,’ he answered, ‘in memory of your words to me at our first meeting\n",
      "\n",
      "And if ever I return to the smithies of my home, it shall be set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house, and a pledge of good will between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days\n",
      "\n",
      "’Then the Lady unbraided one of her long tresses, and cut off three golden hairs, and laid them in Gimli’s hand\n",
      "\n",
      "‘These words shall go with the gift,’ she said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do not foretell, for all foretelling is now vain: on the one hand lies darkness, and on the other only hope\n",
      "\n",
      "But if hope should not fail, then I say to you, Gimli son of Glóin, that your hands shall flow with gold, and yet over you gold shall have no dominion\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And you, Ring-bearer,’ she said, turning to Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I come to you last who are not last in my thoughts\n",
      "\n",
      "For you I have prepared this\n",
      "\n",
      "’ She held up a small crystal phial: it glittered as she moved it, and rays of white light sprang from her hand\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In this phial,’ she said, ‘is caught the light of Eärendil’s star, set amid the waters of my fountain\n",
      "\n",
      "It will shine still brighter when night is about you\n",
      "\n",
      "May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember Galadriel and her Mirror!’Frodo took the phial, and for a moment as it shone between them, he saw her again standing like a queen, great and beautiful, but no longer terrible\n",
      "\n",
      "He bowed, but found no words to say\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Lady arose, and Celeborn led them back to the hythe\n",

      "A yellow noon lay on the green land of the Tongue, and the water glittered with silver\n",

      "\n",
      "Aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished, husbanding their strength against weariness to come\n",
      "\n",
      "But he insisted that at least they should start early each day and journey on far into the evening; for he felt in his heart that time was pressing, and he feared that the Dark Lord had not been idle while they lingered in Lórien\n",

      "As the third day of their voyage wore on the lands changed slowly: the trees thinned and then failed altogether\n",
      "\n",
      "On the eastern bank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching up and away towards the sky; brown and withered they looked, as if fire had passed over them, leaving no living blade of green: an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness\n",
      "\n",
      "They had come to the Brown Lands that lay, vast and desolate, between Southern Mirkwood and the hills of the Emyn Muil\n",
      "\n",
      "What pestilence or war or evil deed of the Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell\n",

      "Upon the west to their right the land was treeless also, but it was flat, and in many places green with wide plains of grass\n",
      "\n",

      "There was no sign of living moving things, save birds\n",
      "\n",
      "Of these there were many: small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds, but they were seldom seen\n",
      "\n",
      "Once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of swan-wings, and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky\n",

      "\n",
      "Sam looked from bank to bank uneasily\n",
      "\n",
      "The trees had seemed hostile before, as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers; now he wished that the trees were still there\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt that the Company was too naked, afloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands, and on a river that was the frontier of war\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next day or two, as they went on, borne steadily southwards, this feeling of insecurity grew on all the Company\n",
      "\n",
      "For a whole day they took to their paddles and hastened forward\n",
      "\n",
      "The banks slid by\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon the River broadened and grew more shallow; long stony beaches lay upon the east, and there were gravel-shoals in the water, so that careful steering was needed\n",
      "\n",
      "The Brown Lands rose into bleak wolds, over which flowed a chill air from the East\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other side the meads had become rolling downs of withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo shivered, thinking of the lawns and fountains, the clear sun and gentle rains of Lothlórien\n",
      "\n",
      "There was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats\n",
      "\n",
      "Each member of the Company was busy with his own thoughts\n",
      "\n",
      "The heart of Legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in some northern glade amid the beech-woods; Gimli was fingering gold in his mind, and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the Lady’s gift\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease, for Boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorn’s\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Pippin, who sat in the bow looking back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam had long ago made up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been brought up to believe, they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined\n",
      "\n",
      "He was cramped and miserable, having nothing to do but stare at the winter-lands crawling by and the grey water on either side of him\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when the paddles were in use they did not trust Sam with one\n",
      "\n",
      "As dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over the bowed heads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats; he was drowsy and longed for camp and the feel of earth under his toes\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly something caught his sight: at first he stared at it listlessly, then he sat up and rubbed his eyes; but when he looked again he could not see it any more\n",
      "\n",
      "That night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam lay rolled in blankets beside Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I had a funny dream an hour or two before we stopped, Mr# Frodo,’ he said\n",

      "\n",
      "Funny it was anyway\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, what was it?’ said Frodo, knowing that Sam would not settle down until he had told his tale, whatever it was\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I haven’t seen or thought of anything to make me smile since we left Lothlórien\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t funny that way, Mr# Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "It was queer\n",
      "\n",
      "All wrong, if it wasn’t a dream\n",
      "\n",
      "And you had best hear it\n",
      "\n",
      "It was like this: I saw a log with eyes!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The log’s all right,’ said Frodo\n",

      "‘There are many in the River\n",

      "But leave out the eyes!’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘’Twas the eyes as made me sit up, so to speak\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw what I took to be a log floating along in the half-light behind Gimli’s boat; but I didn’t give much heed to it\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it seemed as if the log was slowly catching us up\n",
      "\n",
      "And that was peculiar, as you might say, seeing as we were all floating on the stream together\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then I saw the eyes: two pale sort of points, shiny-like, on a hump at the near end of the log\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s more, it wasn’t a log, for it had paddle-feet, like a swan’s almost, only they seemed bigger, and kept dipping in and out of the water\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s when I sat right up and rubbed my eyes, meaning to give a shout, if it was still there when I had rubbed the drowse out of my head\n",
      "\n",
      "For the whatever-it-was was coming along fast now and getting close behind Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "But whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring, or whether I came to my senses, I don’t know\n",
      "\n",
      "When I looked again, it wasn’t there\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet I think I caught a glimpse, with the tail of my eye, as the saying is, of something dark shooting under the shadow of the bank\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn’t see no more eyes, though\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I said to myself: “dreaming again, Sam Gamgee,” I said; and I said no more just then\n",
      "\n",
      "But I’ve been thinking since, and now I’m not so sure\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you make of it, Mr# Frodo?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in your eyes, Sam,’ said Frodo, ‘if this was the first time that those eyes had been seen\n",
      "\n",
      "But it isn’t\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw them away back north before we reached Lórien\n",
      "\n",
      "And I saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night\n",
      "\n",
      "Haldir saw it too\n",
      "\n",
      "And do you remember the report of the Elves that went after the orc-band?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah,’ said Sam, ‘I do; and I remember more too\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t like my thoughts; but thinking of one thing and another, and Mr# Bilbo’s stories and all, I fancy I could put a name on the creature, at a guess\n",
      "\n",
      "A nasty name\n",
      "\n",
      "Gollum, maybe?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, that is what I have feared for some time,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ever since the night on the flet\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose he was lurking in Moria, and picked up our trail then; but I hoped that our stay in Lórien would throw him off the scent again\n",
      "\n",
      "The miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods by the Silverlode, watching us start off!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s about it,’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And we’d better be a bit more watchful ourselves, or we’ll feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of these nights, if we ever wake up to feel anything\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s what I was leading up to\n",
      "\n",
      "No need to trouble Strider or the others tonight\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ll keep watch\n",
      "\n",
      "I can sleep tomorrow, being no more than luggage in a boat, as you might say\n",
      "\n",
      "I might,’ said Frodo, ‘and I might say “luggage with eyes”\n",
      "\n",
      "You shall watch; but only if you promise to wake me half-way towards morning, if nothing happens before then\n",
      "\n",
      "’In the dead hours Frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find Sam shaking him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s a shame to wake you,’ whispered Sam, ‘but that’s what you said\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s nothing to tell, or not much\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I heard some soft plashing and a sniffing noise, a while back; but you hear a lot of such queer sounds by a river at night\n",
      "\n",
      "’He lay down, and Frodo sat up, huddled in his blankets, and fought off his sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "Minutes or hours passed slowly, and nothing happened\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo was just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape, hardly visible, floated close to one of the moored boats\n",
      "\n",
      "A long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly as they peered inside, and then they lifted and gazed up at Frodo on the eyot\n",
      "\n",
      "They were not more than a yard or two away, and Frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood up, drawing Sting from its sheath, and faced the eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately their light was shut off\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another hiss and a splash, and the dark log-shape shot away downstream into the night\n",
      "\n",
      "Aragorn stirred in his sleep, turned over, and sat up\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is it?’ he whispered, springing up and coming to Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I felt something in my sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "Why have you drawn your sword?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Gollum,’ answered Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Or at least, so I guess\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah!’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So you know about our little footpad, do you? He padded after us all through Moria and right down to Nimrodel\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we took to boats, he has been lying on a log and paddling with hands and feet\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried to catch him once or twice at night; but he is slier than a fox, and as slippery as a fish\n",
      "\n",
      "I hoped the river-voyage would beat him, but he is too clever a waterman\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We shall have to try going faster tomorrow\n",
      "\n",
      "You lie down now, and I will keep watch for what is left of the night\n",
      "\n",
      "I wishI could lay my hands on the wretch\n",
      "\n",
      "We might make him useful\n",
      "\n",
      "But if I cannot, we shall have to try and lose him\n",
      "\n",
      "He is very dangerous\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite apart from murder by night on his own account, he may put any enemy that is about on our track\n",
      "\n",
      "’The night passed without Gollum showing so much as a shadow again\n",
      "\n",
      "After that the Company kept a sharp look-out, but they saw no more of Gollum while the voyage lasted\n",
      "\n",
      "If he was still following, he was very wary and cunning\n",
      "\n",
      "At Aragorn’s bidding they paddled now for long spells, and the banks went swiftly by\n",
      "\n",
      "But they saw little of the country, for they journeyed mostly by night and twilight, resting by day, and lying as hidden as the land allowed\n",
      "\n",
      "In this way the time passed without event until the seventh day\n",
      "\n",
      "The weather was still grey and overcast, with wind from the East, but as evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared, and pools of faint light, yellow and pale green, opened under the grey shores of cloud\n",
      "\n",
      "There the white rind of the new Moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lakes\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam looked at it and puckered his brows\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day the country on either side began to change rapidly\n",
      "\n",
      "The banks began to rise and grow stony\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land, and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes of thorn and sloe, tangled with brambles and creepers\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind them stood low crumbling cliffs, and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy; and beyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with wind-writhen firs\n",
      "\n",
      "They were drawing near to the grey hill-country of the Emyn Muil, the southern march of Wilderland\n",
      "\n",
      "There were many birds about the cliffs and the rock-chimneys, and all day high in the air flocks of birds had been circling, black against the pale sky\n",
      "\n",
      "As they lay in their camp that day Aragorn watched the flights doubtfully, wondering if Gollum had been doing some mischief and the news of their voyage was now moving in the wilderness\n",
      "\n",
      "Later as the sun was setting, and the Company was stirring and getting ready to start again, he descried a dark spot against the fading light: a great bird high and far off, now wheeling, now flying on slowly southwards\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What is that, Legolas?’ he asked, pointing to the northern sky\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Is it, as I think, an eagle?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Legolas\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is an eagle, a hunting eagle\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder what that forebodes\n",
      "\n",
      "It is far from the mountains\n",
      "\n",
      "We will not start until it is fully dark,’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "The eighth night of their journey came\n",
      "\n",
      "It was silent and windless; the grey east wind had passed away\n",
      "\n",
      "The thin crescent of the Moon had fallen early into the pale sunset, but the sky was clear above, and though far away in the South there were great ranges of cloud that still shone faintly, in the West stars glinted bright\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come!’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We will venture one more journey by night\n",
      "\n",
      "We are coming to reaches of the River that I do not know well; for I have never journeyed by water in these parts before, not between here and the rapids of Sarn Gebir\n",
      "\n",
      "But if I am right in my reckoning, those are still many miles ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "Still there are dangerous places even before we come there: rocks and stony eyots in the stream\n",
      "\n",
      "We must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly\n",
      "\n",
      "’To Sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman\n",
      "\n",
      "He lay forward peering into the gloom\n",
      "\n",
      "The night grew dark, but the stars above were strangely bright, and there was a glimmer on the face of the River\n",
      "\n",
      "It was close on midnight, and they had been drifting for some while, hardly using the paddles, when suddenly Sam cried out\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed up in the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a swift current which swung left, towards the eastern shore where the channel was clear\n",
      "\n",
      "As they were swept aside the travellers could see, now very close, the pale foam of the River lashing against sharp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth\n",
      "\n",
      "The boats were all huddled together\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hoy there, Aragorn!’ shouted Boromir, as his boat bumped into the leader\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This is madness! We cannot dare the Rapids by night! But no boat can live in Sarn Gebir, be it night or day\n",
      "\n",
      "Back, back!’ cried Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Turn! Turn if you can!’ He drove his paddle into the water, trying to hold the boat and bring it round\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I am out of my reckoning,’ he said to Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I did not know that we had come so far: Anduin flows faster than I thought\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarn Gebir must be close at hand already\n",
      "\n",
      "’With great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them about; but at first they could make only small headway against the current, and all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank\n",
      "\n",
      "Now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All together, paddle!’ shouted Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Paddle! Or we shall be driven on the shoals\n",
      "\n",
      "’ Even as he spoke Frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment there was a twang of bowstrings: several arrows whistled over them, and some fell among them\n",
      "\n",
      "One smote Frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward with a cry, letting go his paddle: but the arrow fell back, foiled by his hidden coat of mail\n",
      "\n",
      "Another passed through Aragorn’s hood; and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the second boat, close by Merry’s hand\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and fro upon the long shingle-banks that lay under the eastern shore\n",
      "\n",
      "They seemed very near\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yrch!’ said Legolas, falling into his own tongue\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Orcs!’ cried Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Gollum’s doing, I’ll be bound,’ said Sam to Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And a nice place to choose, too\n",
      "\n",
      "The River seems set on taking us right into their arms!’They all leaned forward straining at the paddles: even Sam took a hand\n",
      "\n",
      "Every moment they expected to feel the bite of black-feathered arrows\n",
      "\n",
      "Many whined overhead or struck the water nearby; but there were no more hits\n",
      "\n",
      "It was dark, but not too dark for the night-eyes of Orcs, and in the star-glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some mark, unless it was that the grey cloaks of Lórien and the grey timber of the elf-wrought boats defeated the malice of the archers of Mordor\n",
      "\n",
      "Stroke by stroke they laboured on\n",
      "\n",
      "In the darkness it was hard to be sure that they were indeed moving at all; but slowly the swirl of the water grew less, and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, as far as they could judge, they had reached the middle of the stream again and had driven their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks\n",
      "\n",
      "Then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the western shore\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the shadow of bushes leaning out over the water they halted and drew breath\n",
      "\n",
      "Legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought from Lórien\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank\n",
      "\n",
      "Stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned, peering back over the River into the darkness\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the water there were shrill cries, but nothing could be seen\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo looked up at the Elf standing tall above him, as he gazed into the night, seeking a mark to shoot at\n",
      "\n",
      "His head was dark, crowned with sharp white stars that glittered in the black pools of the sky behind\n",
      "\n",
      "But now rising and sailing up from the South the great clouds advanced, sending out dark outriders into the starry fields\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden dread fell on the Company\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Elbereth Gilthoniel!’ sighed Legolas as he looked up\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as he did so, a dark shape, like a cloud and yet not a cloud, for it moved far more swiftly, came out of the blackness in the South, and sped towards the Company, blotting out all light as it approached\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon it appeared as a great winged creature, blacker than the pits in the night\n",
      "\n",
      "Fierce voices rose up to greet it from across the water\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clutching at his heart; there was a deadly cold, like the memory of an old wound, in his shoulder\n",
      "\n",
      "He crouched down, as if to hide\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the great bow of Lórien sang\n",
      "\n",
      "Shrill went the arrow from the elven-string\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo looked up\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost above him the winged shape swerved\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a harsh croaking scream, as it fell out of the air, vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore\n",
      "\n",
      "The sky was clean again\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a tumult of many voices far away, cursing and wailing in the darkness, and then silence\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while Aragorn led the boats back upstream\n",
      "\n",
      "They felt their way along the water’s edge for some distance, until they found a small shallow bay\n",
      "\n",
      "A few low trees grew there close to the water, and behind them rose a steep rocky bank\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Company decided to stay and await the dawn: it was useless to attempt to move further by night\n",
      "\n",
      "They made no camp and lit no fire, but lay huddled in the boats, moored close together\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Praised be the bow of Galadriel, and the hand and eye of Legolas!’ said Gimli, as he munched a wafer of lembas\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That was a mighty shot in the dark, my friend!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But who can say what it hit?’ said Legolas\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I cannot,’ said Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I am glad that the shadow came no nearer\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked it not at all\n",
      "\n",
      "Too much it reminded me of the shadow in Moria – the shadow of the Balrog,’ he ended in a whisper\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It was not a Balrog,’ said Frodo, still shivering with the chill that had come upon him\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It was something colder\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it was——’ Then he paused and fell silent\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you think?’ asked Boromir eagerly, leaning from his boat, as if he was trying to catch a glimpse of Frodo’s face\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think— No, I will not say,’ answered Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Whatever it was, its fall has dismayed our enemies\n",
      "\n",
      "So it seems,’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yet where they are, and how many, and what they will do next, we do not know\n",
      "\n",
      "This night we must all be sleepless! Dark hides us now\n",
      "\n",
      "But what the day will show who can tell? Have your weapons close to hand!’Sam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his fingers, and looking up at the sky\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s very strange,’ he murmured\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Moon’s the same in the Shire and in Wilderland, or it ought to be\n",
      "\n",
      "But either it’s out of its running, or I’m all wrong in my reckoning\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll remember, Mr# Frodo, the Moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that tree: a week from the full, I reckon\n",
      "\n",
      "And we’d been a week on the way last night, when up pops a New Moon as thin as a nail-paring, as if we had never stayed no time in the Elvish country\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, I can remember three nights there for certain, and I seem to remember several more, but I would take my oath it was never a whole month\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyone would think that time did not count in there!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And perhaps that was the way of it,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In that land, maybe, we were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not, I think, until Silverlode bore us back to Anduin that we returned to the time that flows through mortal lands to the Great Sea\n",
      "\n",
      "And I don’t remember any moon, either new or old, in Caras Galadhon: only stars by night and sun by day\n",
      "\n",
      "’Legolas stirred in his boat\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nay, time does not tarry ever,’ he said; ‘but change and growth is not in all things and places alike\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Elves the world moves, and it moves both very swift and very slow\n",
      "\n",
      "Swift, because they themselves change little, and all else fleets by: it is a grief to them\n",
      "\n",
      "Slow, because they need not count the running years, not for themselves\n",
      "\n",
      "The passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet beneath the Sun all things must wear to an end at last\n",
      "\n",
      "But the wearing is slow in Lórien,’ said Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The power of the Lady is on it\n",
      "\n",
      "Rich are the hours, though short they seem, in Caras Galadhon, where Galadriel wields the Elven-ring\n",
      "\n",
      "That should not have been said outside Lórien, not even to me,’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Speak no more of it! But so it is, Sam: in that land you lost your count\n",
      "\n",
      "There time flowed swiftly by us, as for the Elves\n",
      "\n",
      "The old moon passed, and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside, while we tarried there\n",
      "\n",
      "And yestereve a new moon came again\n",
      "\n",
      "Winter is nearly gone\n",
      "\n",
      "Time flows on to a spring of little hope\n",
      "\n",
      "’The night passed silently\n",
      "\n",
      "No voice or call was heard again across the water\n",
      "\n",
      "The travellers huddled in their boats felt the changing of the weather\n",
      "\n",
      "The air grew warm and very still under the great moist clouds that had floated up from the South and the distant seas\n",
      "\n",
      "The rushing of the River over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow louder and closer\n",
      "\n",
      "The twigs of the trees above them began to drip\n",
      "\n",
      "When the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and sad\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly the dawn grew to a pale light, diffused and shadowless\n",
      "\n",
      "There was mist on the River, and white fog swathed the shore; the far bank could not be seen\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can’t abide fog,’ said Sam; ‘but this seems to be a lucky one\n",
      "\n",
      "Now perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Perhaps so,’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But it will be hard to find the path unless the fog lifts a little later on\n",
      "\n",
      "And we must find the path, if we are to pass Sarn Gebir and come to the Emyn Muil\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not see why we should pass the Rapids or follow the River any further,’ said Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If the Emyn Muil lie before us, then we can abandon these cockle-boats, and strike westward and southward, until we come to the Entwash and cross into my own land\n",
      "\n",
      "We can, if we are making for Minas Tirith,’ said Aragorn, ‘but that is not yet agreed\n",
      "\n",
      "And such a course may be more perilous than it sounds\n",
      "\n",
      "The vale of Entwash is flat and fenny, and fog is a deadly peril there for those on foot and laden\n",
      "\n",
      "I would not abandon our boats until we must\n",
      "\n",
      "The River is at least a path that cannot be missed\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Enemy holds the eastern bank,’ objected Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And even if you pass the Gates of Argonath and come unmolested to the Tindrock, what will you do then? Leap down the Falls and land in the marshes?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No!’ answered Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Say rather that we will bear our boats by the ancient way to Rauros-foot, and there take to the water again\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you not know, Boromir, or do you choose to forget the North Stair, and the high seat upon Amon Hen, that were made in the days of the great kings? I at least have a mind to stand in that high place again, before I decide my further course\n",
      "\n",
      "There, maybe, we shall see some sign that will guide us\n",
      "\n",
      "’Boromir held out long against this choice; but when it became plain that Frodo would follow Aragorn, wherever he went, he gave in\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It is not the way of the Men of Minas Tirith to desert their friends at need,’ he said, ‘and you will need my strength, if ever you are to reach the Tindrock\n",
      "\n",
      "To the tall isle I will go, but no further\n",
      "\n",
      "There I shall turn to my home, alone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionship\n",
      "\n",
      "’The day was now growing, and the fog had lifted a little\n",
      "\n",
      "It was decided that Aragorn and Legolas should at once go forward along the shore, while the others remained by the boats\n",
      "\n",
      "Aragorn hoped to find some way by which they could carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the Rapids\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Boats of the Elves would not sink, maybe,’ he said, ‘but that does not say that we should come through Sarn Gebir alive\n",
      "\n",
      "None have ever done so yet\n",
      "\n",
      "No road was made by the Men of Gondor in this region, for even in their great days their realm did not reach up Anduin beyond the Emyn Muil; but there is a portage-way somewhere on the western shore, if I can find it\n",
      "\n",
      "It cannot yet have perished; for light boats used to journey out of Wilderland down to Osgiliath, and still did so until a few years ago, when the Orcs of Mordor began to multiply\n",
      "\n",
      "Seldom in my life has any boat come out of the North, and the Orcs prowl on the east-shore,’ said Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you go forward, peril will grow with every mile, even if you find a path\n",
      "\n",
      "Peril lies ahead on every southward road,’ answered Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Wait for us one day\n",
      "\n",
      "If we do not return in that time, you will know that evil has indeed befallen us\n",
      "\n",
      "Then you must take a new leader and follow him as best you can\n",
      "\n",
      "’It was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas climb the steep bank and vanish into the mists; but his fears proved groundless\n",
      "\n",
      "Only two or three hours had passed, and it was barely mid-day, when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared again\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All is well,’ said Aragorn, as he clambered down the bank\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There is a track, and it leads to a good landing that is still serviceable\n",
      "\n",
      "The distance is not great: the head of the Rapids is but half a mile below us, and they are little more than a mile long\n",
      "\n",
      "Not far beyond them the stream becomes clear and smooth again, though it runs swiftly\n",
      "\n",
      "Our hardest task will be to get our boats and baggage to the old portage-way\n",
      "\n",
      "We have found it, but it lies well back from the water-side here, and runs under the lee of a rock-wall, a furlong or more from the shore\n",
      "\n",
      "We did not find where the northward landing lies\n",
      "\n",
      "If it still remains, we must have passed it yesterday night\n",
      "\n",
      "We might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog\n",
      "\n",
      "I fear we must leave the River now, and make for the portage-way as best we can from here\n",
      "\n",
      "That would not be easy, even if we were all Men,’ said Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yet such as we are we will try it,’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Aye, we will,’ said Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The legs of Men will lag on a rough road, while a Dwarf goes on, be the burden twice his own weight, Master Boromir!’The task proved hard indeed, yet in the end it was done\n",
      "\n",
      "The goods were taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank, where there was a level space\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up\n",
      "\n",
      "They were far less heavy than any had expected\n",
      "\n",
      "Of what tree growing in the Elvish country they were made not even Legolas knew; but the wood was tough and yet strangely light\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry and Pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless it needed the strength of the two Men to lift and haul them over the ground that the Company now had to cross\n",
      "\n",
      "It sloped up away from the River, a tumbled waste of grey limestone-boulders, with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes; there were thickets of brambles, and sheer dells; and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling from the terraces further inland\n",
      "\n",
      "One by one Boromir and Aragorn carried the boats, while the others toiled and scrambled after them with the baggage\n",
      "\n",
      "At last all was removed and laid on the portage-way\n",
      "\n",
      "Then with little further hindrance, save from sprawling briars and many fallen stones, they moved forward all together\n",
      "\n",
      "Fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock-wall, and to their left mist shrouded the River: they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony teeth of Sarn Gebir, but they could not see it\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice they made the journey, before all was brought safe to the southern landing\n",
      "\n",
      "There the portage-way, turning back to the water-side, ran gently down to the shallow edge of a little pool\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to have been scooped in the river-side, not by hand, but by the water swirling down from Sarn Gebir against a low pier of rock that jutted out some way into the stream\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff, and there was no further passage for those on foot\n",
      "\n",
      "Already the short afternoon was past, and a dim cloudy dusk was closing in\n",
      "\n",
      "They sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the Rapids hidden in the mist; they were tired and sleepy, and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, here we are, and here we must pass another night,’ said Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We need sleep, and even if Aragorn had a mind to pass the Gates of Argonath by night, we are all too tired – except, no doubt, our sturdy dwarf\n",
      "\n",
      "’\n",
      "\n",
      "Gimli made no reply: he was nodding as he sat\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Tomorrow we must journey by day again\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless the weather changes once more and cheats us, we shall have a good chance of slipping through, unseen by any eyes on the eastern shore\n",
      "\n",
      "But tonight two must watch together in turns: three hours off and one on guard\n",
      "\n",
      "’Nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour before dawn\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as it was fully light they started\n",
      "\n",
      "Already the fog was thinning\n",
      "\n",
      "They kept as close as they could to the western side, and they could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying river\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mid-morning the clouds drew down lower, and it began to rain heavily\n",
      "\n",
      "They drew the skin-covers over their boats to prevent them from being flooded, and drifted on; little could be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains\n",
      "\n",
      "The rain, however, did not last long\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly the sky above grew lighter, and then suddenly the clouds broke, and their draggled fringes trailed away northward up the River\n",
      "\n",
      "The fogs and mists were gone\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the travellers lay a wide ravine, with great rocky sides to which clung, upon shelves and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn trees\n",
      "\n",
      "The channel grew narrower and the River swifter\n",
      "\n",
      "Now they were speeding along with little hope of stopping or turning, whatever they might meet ahead\n",
      "\n",
      "Over them was a lane of pale-blue sky, around them the dark overshadowed River, and before them black, shutting out the sun, the hills of Emyn Muil, in which no opening could be seen\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching: like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed\n",
      "\n",
      "Tall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the stream\n",
      "\n",
      "A narrow gap appeared between them, and the River swept the boats towards it\n",

      "\n",
      "He saw as through a mist a wide flat circle, paved with mighty flags, and surrounded with a crumbling battlement; and in the middle, set upon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached by a stair of many steps\n",

      "Up he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like a lost child that had clambered upon the throne of mountain-kings\n",

      "\n",
      "He seemed to be in a world of mist in which there were only shadows: the Ring was upon him\n",

      "Then here and there the mist gave way and he saw many visions: small and clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table, and yet remote\n",

      "There was no sound, only bright living images\n",
      "\n",
      "The world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Southward he looked, and below his very feet the Great River curled like a toppling wave and plunged over the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume\n",
      "\n",
      "And Ethir Anduin he saw, the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of sea-birds whirling like a white dust in the sun, and beneath them a green and silver sea, rippling in endless lines\n",
      "\n",
      "But everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war\n",
      "\n",
      "The Misty Mountains were crawling like anthills: orcs were issuing out of a thousand holes\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the boughs of Mirkwood there was deadly strife of Elves and Men and fell beasts\n",
      "\n",
      "The land of the Beornings was aflame; a cloud was over Moria; smoke rose on the borders of Lórien\n",
      "\n",
      "Horsemen were galloping on the grass of Rohan; wolves poured from Isengard\n",
      "\n",
      "From the havens of Harad ships of war put out to sea; and out of the East Men were moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon horses, chariots of chieftains and laden wains\n",
      "\n",
      "All the power of the Dark Lord was in motion\n",
      "\n",
      "Then turning south again he beheld Minas Tirith\n",
      "\n",
      "Far away it seemed, and beautiful: white-walled, many-towered, proud and fair upon its mountain-seat; its battlements glittered with steel, and its turrets were bright with many banners\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope leaped in his heart\n",
      "\n",
      "But against Minas Tirith was set another fortress, greater and more strong\n",
      "\n",
      "Thither, eastward, unwilling his eye was drawn\n",
      "\n",
      "It passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath, the grinning gates of Minas Morgul, and the haunted Mountains, and it looked upon Gorgoroth, the valley of terror in the Land of Mordor\n",

      "Darkness lay there under the Sun\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire glowed amid the smoke\n",

      "\n",
      "Then at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw it: Barad-dûr, Fortress of Sauron\n",
      "\n",
      "All hope left him\n",
      "\n",
      "And suddenly he felt the Eye\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an eye in the Dark Tower that did not sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew that it had become aware of his gaze\n",
      "\n",
      "A fierce eager will was there\n",
      "\n",
      "It leaped towards him; almost like a finger he felt it, searching for him\n",
      "\n",
      "Very soon it would nail him down, know just exactly where he was\n",
      "\n",
      "Amon Lhaw it touched\n",
      "\n",
      "It glanced upon Tol Brandir – he threw himself from the seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard himself crying out: Never, never! Or was it: Verily I come, I come to you? He could not tell\n",
      "\n",
      "Then as a flash from some other point of power there came to his mind another thought: Take it off! Take it off! Fool, take it off! Take off the Ring!The two powers strove in him\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment, perfectly balanced between their piercing points, he writhed, tormented\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he was aware of himself again, Frodo, neither the Voice nor the Eye: free to choose, and with one remaining instant in which to do so\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the Ring off his finger\n",
      "\n",
      "He was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat\n",
      "\n",
      "A black shadow seemed to pass like an arm above him; it missed Amon Hen and groped out west, and faded\n",
      "\n",
      "Then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in every tree\n",
      "\n",
      "Frodo rose to his feet\n",
      "\n",
      "A great weariness was on him, but his will was firm and his heart lighter\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke aloud to himself\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will do now what I must,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This at least is plain: the evil of the Ring is already at work even in the Company, and the Ring must leave them before it does more harm\n",
      "\n",
      "I will go alone\n",
      "\n",
      "Some I cannot trust, and those I can trust are too dear to me: poor old Sam, and Merry and Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "Strider, too: his heart yearns for Minas Tirith, and he will be needed there, now Boromir has fallen into evil\n",
      "\n",
      "I will go alone\n",
      "\n",
      "At once\n",
      "\n",
      "’He went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where Boromir had found him\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he halted, listening\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought he could hear cries and calls from the woods near the shore below\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They’ll be hunting for me,’ he said\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wonder how long I have been away\n",
      "\n",
      "Hours, I should think\n",
      "\n",
      "’ He hesitated\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What can I do?’ he muttered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I must go now or I shall never go\n",
      "\n",
      "I shan’t get a chance again\n",
      "\n",
      "I hate leaving them, and like this without any explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "But surely they will understand\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam will\n",
      "\n",
      "And what else can I do?’Slowly he drew out the Ring and put it on once more\n",
      "\n",
      "He vanished and passed down the hill, less than a rustle of the wind\n",
      "\n",
      "The others remained long by the river-side\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time they had been silent, moving restlessly about; but now they were sitting in a circle, and they were talking\n",
      "\n",
      "Every now and again they made efforts to speak of other things, of their long road and many adventures; they questioned Aragorn concerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient history, and the remnants of its great works that could still be seen in this strange border-land of the Emyn Muil: the stone kings and the seats of Lhaw and Hen, and the great Stair beside the falls of Rauros\n",
      "\n",
      "But always their thoughts and words strayed back to Frodo and the Ring\n",
      "\n",
      "What would Frodo choose to do? Why was he hesitating?‘He is debating which course is the most desperate, I think,’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And well he may\n",
      "\n",
      "It is now more hopeless than ever for the Company to go east, since we have been tracked by Gollum, and must fear that the secret of our journey is already betrayed\n",
      "\n",
      "But Minas Tirith is no nearer to the Fire and the destruction of the Burden\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We may remain there for a while and make a brave stand; but the Lord Denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even Elrond said was beyond his power: either to keep the Burden secret, or to hold off the full might of the Enemy when he comes to take it\n",
      "\n",
      "Which way would any of us choose in Frodo’s place? I do not know\n",
      "\n",
      "Now indeed we miss Gandalf most\n",
      "\n",
      "Grievous is our loss,’ said Legolas\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yet we must needs make up our minds without his aid\n",
      "\n",
      "Why cannot we decide, and so help Frodo? Let us call him back and then vote! I should vote for Minas Tirith\n",
      "\n",
      "And so should I,’ said Gimli\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We, of course, were only sent to help the Bearer along the road, to go no further than we wished; and none of us is under any oath or command to seek Mount Doom\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard was my parting from Lothlórien\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet I have come so far, and I say this: now we have reached the last choice, it is clear to me that I cannot leave Frodo\n",
      "\n",
      "I would choose Minas Tirith, but if he does not, then I follow him\n",
      "\n",
      "And I too will go with him,’ said Legolas\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It would be faithless now to say farewell\n",
      "\n",
      "It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But if he goes east, then all need not go with him; nor do I think that all should\n",
      "\n",
      "That venture is desperate: as much so for eight as for three or two, or one alone\n",
      "\n",
      "If you would let me choose, then I should appoint three companions: Sam, who could not bear it otherwise; and Gimli; and myself\n",
      "\n",
      "Boromir will return to his own city, where his father and his people need him; and with him the others should go, or at least Meriadoc and Peregrin, if Legolas is not willing to leave us\n",
      "\n",
      "That won’t do at all!’ cried Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We can’t leave Frodo! Pippin and I always intended to go wherever he went, and we still do\n",
      "\n",
      "But we did not realize what that would mean\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed different so far away, in the Shire or in Rivendell\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be mad and cruel to let Frodo go to Mordor\n",
      "\n",
      "Why can’t we stop him?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We must stop him,’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And that is what he is worrying about, I am sure\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows we shan’t agree to his going east\n",
      "\n",
      "And he doesn’t like to ask anyone to go with him, poor old fellow\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine it: going off to Mordor alone!’ Pippin shuddered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But the dear silly old hobbit, he ought to know that he hasn’t got to ask\n",
      "\n",
      "He ought to know that if we can’t stop him, we shan’t leave him\n",
      "\n",
      "Begging your pardon,’ said Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t think you understand my master at all\n",
      "\n",
      "He isn’t hesitating about which way to go\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course not! What’s the good of Minas Tirith anyway? To him, I mean, begging your pardon, Master Boromir,’ he added, and turned\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then that they discovered that Boromir, who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle, was no longer there\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now where’s he got to?’ cried Sam, looking worried\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He’s been a bit queer lately, to my mind\n",
      "\n",
      "But anyway he’s not in this business\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s off to his home, as he always said; and no blame to him\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr# Frodo, he knows he’s got to find the Cracks of Doom, if he can\n",
      "\n",
      "But he’s afraid\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it’s come to the point, he’s just plain terrified\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s what his trouble is\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course he’s had a bit of schooling, so to speak – we all have – since we left home, or he’d be so terrified he’d just fling the Ring in the River and bolt\n",
      "\n",
      "But he’s still too frightened to start\n",
      "\n",
      "And he isn’t worrying about us either: whether we’ll go along with him or no\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows we mean to\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s another thing that’s bothering him\n",
      "\n",
      "If he screws himself up to go, he’ll want to go alone\n",
      "\n",
      "Mark my words! We’re going to have trouble when he comes back\n",
      "\n",
      "For he’ll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name’s Baggins\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe you speak more wisely than any of us, Sam,’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And what shall we do, if you prove right?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Stop him! Don’t let him go!’ cried Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wonder?’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He is the Bearer, and the fate of the Burden is on him\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not think that it is our part to drive him one way or the other\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor do I think that we should succeed, if we tried\n",
      "\n",
      "There are other powers at work far stronger\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I wish Frodo would “screw himself up” and come back, and let us get it over,’ said Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This waiting is horrible! Surely the time is up?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The hour is long passed\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning is wearing away\n",
      "\n",
      "We must call for him\n",
      "\n",
      "’At that moment Boromir reappeared\n",
      "\n",
      "He came out from the trees and walked towards them without speaking\n",
      "\n",
      "His face looked grim and sad\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused as if counting those that were present, and then sat down aloof, with his eyes on the ground\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Where have you been, Boromir?’ asked Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Have you seen Frodo?’Boromir hesitated for a second\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, and no,’ he answered slowly\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes: I found him some way up the hill, and I spoke to him\n",
      "\n",
      "I urged him to come to Minas Tirith and not to go east\n",
      "\n",
      "I grew angry and he left me\n",
      "\n",
      "He vanished\n",
      "\n",
      "I have never seen such a thing happen before, though I have heard of it in tales\n",
      "\n",
      "He must have put the Ring on\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not find him again\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought he would return to you\n",
      "\n",
      "Is that all that you have to say?’ said Aragorn, looking hard and not too kindly at Boromir\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ he answered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I will say no more yet\n",
      "\n",
      "This is bad!’ cried Sam, jumping up\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know what this Man has been up to\n",
      "\n",
      "Why should Mr# Frodo put the thing on? He didn’t ought to have; and if he has, goodness knows what may have happened!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But he wouldn’t keep it on,’ said Merry\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not when he had escaped the unwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used to\n",
      "\n",
      "But where did he go? Where is he?’ cried Pippin\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He’s been away ages now\n",
      "\n",
      "How long is it since you saw Frodo last, Boromir?’ asked Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Half an hour, maybe,’ he answered\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Or it might be an hour\n",
      "\n",
      "I have wandered for some time since\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know! I do not know!’ He put his head in his hands, and sat as if bowed with grief\n",
      "\n",
      "‘An hour since he vanished!’ shouted Sam\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We must try and find him at once\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Wait a moment!’ cried Aragorn\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We must divide up into pairs, and arrange – here, hold on! Wait!’It was no good\n",
      "\n",
      "They took no notice of him\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam had dashed off first\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry and Pippin had followed, and were already disappearing westward into the trees by the shore, shouting: Frodo! Frodo! in their clear, high, hobbit-voices\n",

      "\n",
      "A sudden panic or madness seemed to have fallen on the Company\n",
